review
"<span>Their most underrated album, in that impressionable fools tend to write it off as a respectable warm-up(/noble beginning/time-biding before <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em> or whatever the point is when the attention spans kick in these days) when in fact these guys were knockin' yer fuckin' ass outta the park right from the get-go.<br><br>Consider the chord progressions, at once rockingly flashy and countryfied, like they've been unearthed from decades ago but really sounded unlike anything else at the time — and played with a phrasing akin to the grottiest garages and the dirtiest r&amp;b. I mean Jesus, listen to the sharp, jittered-up licks in ""I Saw Her Standing There"". Listen to the bass fills in the title track, like gleeful little whispers. Listen to the way George splurts out the first two or three notes of each of his phrases in ""Anna"" and then does a little boomerang back to the root and slow down, like being given a light push (in accordance with the words). Compare it to the relatively straight-ahead chords of most other pop of the time and realize how actually, yeah, in fact, these guys really <em class=""rymfmt"">were</em> That Important.<br><br>Consider the vocals, and how subliminally raw and fucking <em class=""rymfmt"">humanist</em> they were at the same time — the effect is that of listening to a bunch of talented people happily purge their souls through an adrenaline rush, even as they sing songs <em class=""rymfmt"">as if they know these feelings they're singing about well, and care about them and the people who feel the same way.</em> And all without sacrificing individualism! Paul's zen-like control interspersed with rocketing blasts to lift the roof off; George's slyness in ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" (and his druggy harmony in ""Anna""), claiming his position from the get-go as the mischievous one who's always in on the joke (enjoy the way he carries his 'aaooooohooooo...' to directly roll off the upward guitar arpeggio); Ringo's best-ever vocal in the awesome, <em class=""rymfmt"">awesome</em> cover of ""Boys"" (by The Shirelles; the Fabs <em class=""rymfmt"">don't</em> alter the words), holding together only because nobody else in the room apparently is. (Those shrieks, those hoots! The drum roll under the first 'hey' in the chorus! It stirs you up, man!) And John, forever the most thoughtfully sensitive: his voice continually reaching up in ""Anna"", about to reach the cracking point, and then sinking down with the 'ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhh'; the guttural roil in that one 'come on' in ""Please Please Me""; his jolly 'h-ho!'s in ""Baby It's You"" soon undercut by his very raw '<em class=""rymfmt"">can't help myseeeeelf!</em>' (or '<em class=""rymfmt"">don't want noboooody!</em>'); ""Twist and Shout"", where he does just that. The shredding, fuckin' <em class=""rymfmt"">shredding</em> sexual paganism - that's right, 'shredding sexual paganism,' I stand by it - in that closing song...that's a <em class=""rymfmt"">coronation.</em> A new age.<br><br>Consider the harmonic contours. The aforementioned drugginess in ""Anna""; the Baroque-ish phrasing of the flick down the piano in ""Misery"", the page-fluttering mystical guitar twinkle-sweeping ('page-fluttering mystical guitar twinkle-sweeping' — got it) in Paul's tempo-shifting, dreamy-yet-dusty English music hall ballad melody in ""A Taste of Honey""; the wise decision for both John and Paul to sing ""Chains"", making the greatest part of the song - the 'ohhh-ohhh-these chains...' hook in the middle of the chorus - come on stronger and more singalongable as a result; the flutters in ""Ask Me Why"", which may be a little cruise-shippy in their near-barbershop way but are still a fine counterpoint to <em class=""rymfmt"">that</em> tune; the transitional 'sha-la-la's in ""Baby It's You"" that almost sound like they're half-teasing John's (very) pained vocal at first but eventually (somehow) give off a comfort, like they've come closer and proven more sympathetic.<br><br>Consider the most direct emotional content. People like to take shots at <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> because of the safe, conventionally lovey-dovey stuff in the lyrics. And y'know, fair enough — any band that doesn't even <em class=""rymfmt"">try</em> to play-up sadomasochistic implications in Carole King's ""Chains"" is obviously still playing it a little gentle. But...well, two things. One, it's partly what you <em class=""rymfmt"">do</em> with the lyrics that makes them special, and these performances - the mischief, the control, the rawness, the primal release - usually rise above the words. Of the 14 songs, only the labored, sloppy, outright corny ""P.S. I Love You"" falls unequivocally flat (I laugh - <em class=""rymfmt"">at</em> the song, not with it - when Paul echoes 'send my love to you' with that brassy 'you know I want you to remember!'), although it must be said that the attempt at a bridge in ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" ('I've known a secret for a week or two...') is one of the most half-assed things on a Beatles album. And two, the lyrics in the originals can range from very good indeed (i.e. ""I Saw Her Standing There""; ""There's a Place"") to perfectly harmless without being overly hammy (i.e. everything else except ""P.S. I Love You"", which does cross the ham checkpoint), and the covers - being so prominent - lend much of the gravity here. Their choices here are appropriate for intimacy as well as endorphins: ""Anna"" lets John stretch out in his loneliness and deliver genuine understanding ('...but if he loves you more, go with him') with just a little, human stab of bitterness, and the 'cheat...cheat...cheat...' backing vocals in the Bacharach-David song ""Baby It's You"", about a guy who pledges to stay with a girl who's rumored to be unfaithful, are sung a little more savagely than the chart norms of the time, undercutting John's almost helpless-sounding performance (that's a compliment) to make the whole thing feel weightier than its basics. And ""There's a Place"", an original, is the first instance of John's snowballing pursuance of a - to quote George Starostin - sweet spiritual dreamworld. (The 'place' is his mind. Dig it? I do. Especially with such a pure, no-frills, honest little melody going with it.)<br><br>Most of all, though, consider the sense of, if you will, <em class=""rymfmt"">unified energy</em>, and the sense that this was a band that felt - feels - like they're singing both <em class=""rymfmt"">to</em> you and <em class=""rymfmt"">for</em> you at the same time. Most acts hedge their bets on just one side of that fence, and none danced that line with such impeccable balance for as long as these guys did. Would their songwriting get better? Of course it would. (Although y'know, even ""Love Me Do"" has that great harmonica hook.) Everything would swell. But the band would never be this simultaneously raw and pure again. Few would.<br><br>Though my personal favorite song here is the title track (the tune alone is beyond reproach; thank you, George Martin, for urging them to speed it up), the one that most exemplifies the group at this point, and for that matter their whole generation at this point, is - you guessed it - the first one. It's very common to hear people say that ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a burst-out-of-the-gateway album opener for the ages, especially thanks to that immortal opening lyric. And they're right. But beyond the sheer situational intrigue of using those lines - 'She was just seventeen/You know what I mean' - as an entrance, the true brilliance of said entrance was perfectly summed-up by Ian MacDonald in <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution in the Head</em>. MacDonald pointed out that if John and Paul had written 'sixteen' instead of 'seventeen,' it would've been standard fare. ('Aww, sweet sixteen! Starry-eyed romance! Cute!') By making the age one year <em class=""rymfmt"">older</em>, they made it more dangerous; 'seventeen' doesn't carry the same sweetness as 'sixteen.' It carries...other things. So I think we all know what they mean. MacDonald goes on to observe that 'Its hero's heart didn't 'sing' or 'take wing' when he beheld his lady love; this guy's heart 'went boom' when he 'crossed the room' – a directness of metaphor and movement.' In other words: it's genius, I tell ya!<br><br>Half a bloody century!<br><br>A.</span>,<span>Na swoim profilu objaśniłem co oznacza ocena ""2"" - ""Poor, but listenable"". To jest najidealniejsze określenie całej muzyki Beatlesów, której ""wielkość"" jest jednym z największych nieporozumień w historii muzyki. Zespół słaby technicznie, absolutnie nienowatorski (wbrew krążącym opiniom) i mało kreatywny, aczkolwiek mający dryg do pisania chwytliwych pioseneczek jest wynoszony, nawet przez bardzo poważnych krytyków, do miana genialnego. Nie mam osobistej antypatii do Beatlesów, po prostu widzę fakty, a te są takie, że ten przeciętny zespół jest kreacją medialno - marketingową, a swój sukces zawdzięcza ""komercyjności doskonałej"". Trochę rock and rolla, trochę francuskich chanson, tu utwór a'la big band, tu balladka, tam mizerny folczek... wszystko w formacie ok 3 minutowym (z wyjątkami), maksymalnie wysterylizowane z czegokolwiek co mogłoby być dla słuchacza wymagające. Potęga mediów + nieumiejętność odseparowania się od młodzieńczych fascynacji dzisiejszych kreatorów trendów i mamy geniusz! Ja też uwielbiałem Beatlesów w młodszych latach.<br>Im jednak więcej wiedzy o muzyce rockowej zdobywałem, tym bardziej jasne stawało się dla mnie, że stawianie ich na piedestale jest niedorzecznością. Chciałbym przy tym zaznaczyć, że jest to muzyka przyjemna, wprawiająca w dobry nastrój, ale do bólu schlebiająca gustom, pisana pod jak najszerszy target, ale nijak nie dająca się uczciwie określić jako ważna w historii rocka (chyba, że bierzemy pod uwagę właśnie aspekt marketingowy).<br>Po tym przydługim wstępie (""Please, please me"" jest pierwszym LP w karierze Beatlesów, więc uznałem, że to dobre miejsce na opisanie mojej postawy wobec tego bandu) przejdę do samej płyty. Nie dam się porwać szaleństwu omawiania z osobna każdego kawałka, jakby był elementem objawienia. Prawda jest taka, że są to zwykłe piosenki, niewiele różniące się od tych, które w tamtych czasach się śpiewało. Harcerskie akordy, chórki, miejscami ciekawe i zapadające w pamięć melodie (utwór tytułowy). Prawie połowa z utworów zamieszczonych na płycie to covery opracowane bez nadmiernego polotu, właściwie po prostu ""odegrane"" i wsjo. Podsumowując: <br>""Please, please me"" to nie żaden owoc geniuszu, a tylko prosta, schematyczna, niewymagająca muzyka, dobra do pośpiewania przy ognisku.</span>,<span>It's the Beatles' first album, and it sure does sound like it. At this stage of your life, you've probably seen enough infomercials, documentaries, interviews, news stories, and so on and so forth about how the Beatles evolved from boy band to Eastern World spiritualist rock immortals, and this is the charming infancy. ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Anna (Go to Him)"", ""Twist and Shout"", among others--the true bridge between rock n' roll and British Invasion.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me with Love Me Do and 12 other songs</em> is an album that divides Beatles fans, and understandably so.  Fans of the group's later material criticize it as essentially a ""boy band"" record, its limited and naive lyrical focus on heterosexual, teenage relationships.  Fans of the record tend to like it because John Lennon thought it was the closest any of their records came to replicating the live sound of their Cavern Club and Hamburg, Germany shows.  The truth lies somewhere in the middle.  <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is a solid debut LP, featuring an immediacy and youthful exuberance lacking on subsequent Beatles LPs.  That being said, many of their original compositions and a few of the cover selections are tepid at best, and some of the weakest material in the group's entire back catalog.<br><br>Ten of the album's fourteen songs (""Love Me Do,"" ""P.S. I Love You,"" ""Please Please Me,"" and ""Ask Me Why"" were recorded at previous sessions) were recorded over three separate, simple, yet grueling three-hour sessions on February 11, 1963.  This is why the album has such a spare sound, with The Beatles performing all the material live in the studio sans overdubs.  Essentially, The Beatles were on the clock and had to prove to producer George Martin that they were ready to be signed to a major label.  The results are better than one would expect, especially those familiar with their shoddy Decca Records demos of January 1, 1962 (many of which are included on <em class=""rymfmt"">Anthology 1</em>).  ""McCartney-Lennon"" originals (as they were then credited) like ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""There's a Place"" are thoroughly convincing rockers, signs of their eventual legendary status as songwriters.  Others, like ""Misery"" and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" are fairly weak.  The same thing applies to the covers.  ""Boys,"" originally recorded by The Shirelles, is Ringo Starr's vocal turn on the album, and is easily one of the best tracks on here.  Boldy, Starr decides to preserve the original gender coding of the girl-group song.  That being said, ""Anna (Go to Him),"" ""Chains,"" and ""A Taste of Honey"" are unconvincing.  The most legendary performance on the album is easily ""Twist and Shout,"" a cover of the Isley Brothers hit.  As the last song recorded during the long session, John Lennon's voice is fairly shot.  As a result, his rasping, strained voice adds a stunning vitality to the track, recorded famously in one take.  No other cover performance in their discography is as necessary to their legend as this one.  As for the material from their two previous singles, both McCartney-Lennon originals ""Love Me Do"" (their first A-side) and ""P.S. I Love You"" are weak, especially when measured against their later work.  (The version of ""Love Me Do"" on the album, now the definitive one, actually features Andy White on drums -- Ringo Starr appears on the 45.)  ""Please Please Me"" is their first great A-side.  Borrowing moves from Roy Orbison, it is as dramatic as one of his songs, but rocks with an intensity he could never muster.  The B-side, ""Ask Me Why,"" however, might be the weakest song in their official back-catalog.<br><br>Despite the fairly average quality of the songs taken as a whole, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is an early triumph in rock album sequencing.  ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is the perfect track to start the album with, and ""Please Please Me"" is a great closer for Side One.  ""Love Me Do"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" are suitable openers for Side Two.  The last two cuts on the album are arguably the best, ""There's a Place"" (one of the hidden gems in the Beatles discography -- which predates The Beach Boys' similarly introspective ""In My Room"" by about nine months) and the aforementioned ""Twist and Shout.""  When the group cheers nailing the song in one take at the end of the performance, the listener similarly feels victorious.  It's one of the great early moments in the history of rock albums.</span>,<span>In a perverse way, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> initially seems like a slightly better album than the rest of the early Beatles records, because nothing on it reaches the heights of ""A Hard Day's Night"" or ""Help!"".  With nothing great to show them up, songs like ""Please Please Me"", and ""Love Me Do"" sound pretty okay.  Shame that they're quickly exposed by repeated listens to be average in the extreme.  In defense of ""Please Please Me"", we can at least say that the sense of equality Lennon brings to blowjobs here ('please please me, oh yeah, like I please you') puts it a cut above all the other sexist drivel he'd spout in the future, but that's not really a plus point so much as a reason why it's not awful.<br><br>Outside of the famous tracks, the rest often <em class=""rymfmt"">is</em> awful, with a few covers to redeem it.  And that's an important thing to note about this album, and the few that followed it.  Somehow music critics throughout the ages have managed to romanticize the way Lennon and McCartney wrote their songs, 'eyeball to eyeball', bashing out song after song in double-quick time.  Indeed, this entire album is meant to have been recorded in a day.  Now let's be honest - is this meant to be a <em class=""rymfmt"">good</em> thing?  The songs on here that were written by seasoned songwriters - Carole King and Gerry Goffin on ""Chains"", Arthur Alexander on ""Anna (Go to Him)"", Bert Berns on ""Twist &amp; Shout"", David &amp; Bacharach on ""Baby It's You"" - show up the efforts of The Beatles themselves as amateurish.  It's really tough to sum up just how poor tracks like ""P.S. I Love You"", ""Ask Me Why"", and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" are, other to say that, yes, they <em class=""rymfmt"">do</em> sound like they were written by beginners and performed in a hurry.<br><br>At least there's ""I Saw Her Standing There"", which is a cut above everything else here and then some, and ""Twist and Shout"", where Lennon turns in one of his best vocal performances ever.  Elsewhere, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is dull and lazy.  Anybody who remembers Cristiano Ronaldo's wasteful, frustrating first season in a Manchester United shirt will know what I mean when I saw that this is a mile away from the 2007/2008 glory days of <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em>.</span>,<span>I don't have a huge chip on my shoulder re: The Beatles like a lot of people develop on this site. I can still easily listen to this and hear a couple of really great pop songs, amongst what is definitely some fairly standard &amp; average r&amp;b/pop fare. To some extent I prefer the simpler, rougher &amp; simply more joyful sounding incarnation of the 4 Liverpudlians, than their later stuff, where they started taking themselves a bit too seriously. I still have to chuckle at the effect that George's visit to India had on both the group and Western music in general...</span>,<span>Careers, like lives, have starting points. You start out with no experience and novice skills, and grow from there. From this perspective, it's clear that if their early days playing clubs were infancy, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> marks the Beatles in Kindergarten. The record is playful, carefree, and is pretty good- for a kindergartener.<br><br>The record, like most before the year 1965, hinges on a few critical singles. Thankfully, for the record's sake, they are freaking awesome. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a great lead in for a career due to its catchiness, simplicity, and unique enough name. The record contains five other stone cold classics: ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", ""P.S. I Love You"", ""Twist and Shout"" and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"". Having six songs this strong right off the bat definatly helped their popularity soar and spur Beatlemania. However, that's all the record has to offer. Many of the covers are ill advised- ""Boys"" obviously is not intended to be done by men and I can't believe they pulled off something so homoerotic in 1963. Then there's also tracks like ""Chains"", which isn't really a good song to begin with. Lennon and McCartney were not a flawless partnership on the album either- ""There's a Place"" is one of the Beatles' most forgettable numbers.<br><br>Regardless, they produced six tracks that strong are enough to carry the album. It's a fun effort. Of course, it's a kindergartener effort, so it just copies what it sees and doesn’t branch out too far from influences. The crayon goes outside of the lines, and the signature is illegible. But everyone must start somewhere. Is <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> any indication of what these four Liverpudlians would go on to do? No. Is it worth a spin? Yeah, sure it is.</span>,<span>Raw and trad at the same time. The R&amp;B covers are quite brittle, and although the vocals (mostly John's, in this case) aren't nearly as malleable as their soul forebears, it's still a sight less polite than anything else coming from White popsters. ""Boys"" gets punched up like the Reeperbahn must've demanded (did Ringo ever sing a Beatles song poorly? in terms of sheer batting average, it'd have to be Ringo, Paul, John, and last George), though. ""Twist and Shout"" is to the Isleys' original what Justin Timberlake is to Brian Eno.<br><br>The originals are mostly &amp; fascinatingly staid - leading off with the pounding ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a little cruel... The ""oo-oo-oo""s and ""i-yi-yi-yine""s of ""Ask Me Why"" are incredibly goofy. ""Love Me Do"" is compositionally primitive. ""There's a Place"" is charming, with some quick shots into the upper register that are nearly without antecedent in the Beatles' catalog. The mosquito-ish harmonica is the real star.<br> <br>""P.S. I Love You"" is a lovely gimmick song, proving that Paul was at his best in dying or dead idioms (not counting arena rock). His responses in the last verse are inspired. And ""Please Please Me"" shows their nascent talent for cooking up magic. Ringo's fills are tasty, &amp; the boys' guitar stops build and release tension for the coming pop zeitgeist.</span>"
"<span>When you see a copy of <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em> in a person's record collection, you know the person is either a serious record collector, a serious Beatles fan, or both.  Now, though I like the Beatles, I wouldn't consider myself to be a serious Beatles fan.  I've seen what real Beatles fans are like, they're worse than trekkies.  OK, nobody's worse than trekkies, I was exaggerating.<br><br>My best friend in grade school was a trekkie.  He'd seen every episode and he owned a blue starfleet uniform, which he'd often wear to school.  Grade school.  He went on the become a serious computer geek who couldn't score with the ladies.  No surprise there.  He didn't like the Beatles.  Neither did I.  I liked the BeeGees.  He liked Country Music.  <em class=""rymfmt"">My heart's on fire for Elvira!</em><br><br>I like the Beatles these days, though.  Heck, these days I think the Beatles are keen.  I'm just not a Beatles nut.  Did I mention I own a copy of <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em>?<br><br>Well, I do.<br><br>Since I'm more of a casual, laid back Beatles fan rather than a serious fan, that must mean I'm a serious record collector.  What else could it be?<br><br>Ok, maybe you don't know a lot about record collecting.  Why am I asserting that anybody that owns a copy of this record must be a major record collector or Beatles fan in the first place?  Surely there's thousands, nay millions, of copies of <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em> lying around.  I mean, we're talking about the most popular band in the history of recorded music, right?  Actually, that's not the case.  <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em> was released on a small U.S. label before the Beatles stormed these shores.  Few copies are known to exist.  I own one.  Therefore I must be a serious record collector.<br><br><br>Let's see how much my record-with-an-alternate-version-of-""I-Saw-Her-Standing-There"" is worth these days, shall we?  I just happen to have a copy of Goldmine's Record Album Price Guide sitting in my lap by sheer coincidence.  I own a stereophonic copy.  Let's see here.  Hmmm.  SR 1062.  Vee Jay.  Black Label.  The back cover has song titles on it.<br><br>$7000.<br><br>That's just for the cover.  Fuckin' A!  The record itself is worth another $600.<br><br>$7600!  Heck yeah!  Who's your daddy!?!?!?!<br><br>That's the best $8 I ever spent.<br><br>What's this?  ""How to Spot a Counterfeit"".  Whah?<br><br><em class=""rymfmt""> -- Labels that have ""THE BEATLES"" and ""INTRODUCING The BEATLES"" separated by the center hole are fakes.</em><br><br>Oh.<br><br>Um.<br><br>Well . . . hey, it's only $600.  That's nothing a couple permanent markers can't fix anyway, plus I've still got that $7000 cover.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt""> -- Covers for the stereo issue that list Love Me Do and P.

heh.  Heck, at least the sound quality is pretty good.</span>,<span>Although rock and roll wasn't dead by 1963, a fairly compelling case can be made that it was limping towards the grave.  None of the original fifties pioneers of the genre had the impact that they once did.  Sure, a handful of acts, like Dion or the Everly Brothers, were still managing to cut a decent side now and then, but Elvis had gone to Hollywood, Chuck Berry had gone to jail, and Buddy Holly was gone forever.<br><br>It's a testament to just how different the world was at the time that no one (especially in America) could have envisioned rock and roll being reborn as an import.  Luckily for music lovers, scores of young Brits had been studying and internalizing those American fifties sides, and the brightest of these students were four ""long-haired"" lads from Liverpool.<br><br>It might have been enough for the Beatles to rely strictly on cover versions of American hits.  Their infectious energy having been missing in the genre for years.  Even at this early stage though, the Beatles were redefining what rock and roll was; taking the foundation and building on it.<br><br>This album was revelatory simply by virtue of it being conceived of as more than a showcase for a hit single, surrounded by whatever else could be thrown together to fill out an LP's thirty minute run time.  The Beatles were brash enough to work to change the rules from the outset, and George Martin was smart enough to be open to their ideas.<br><br>Four decades later, the album is still something special.  From McCartney's instinctive knack for melody, to Lennon's compelling voice, to the group's amazing ear for harmonies and arrangements, it was readily apparent that, while the boys were having fun, they were undoubtedly serious about their musicianship.  Some numbers have aged better than others, but songs like ""Twist and Shout"", ""There's A Place"" (which anyone else would have likely performed as a lachrymose ballad),""Baby, It's You"", and the impeccably crafted ""Ask Me Why"" indicated that they were already capable of creating something timeless.<br><br>Some reviewers may be more than willing to dismiss <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> simply because it isn't <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em>, but even if the group had never followed up this album, never gone to America, never conquered the world, those lucky enough to have discovered <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> would still marvel at how good it is!</span>,<span>I’ve been kicking around this website for some time now and its finally time to pull out the big guns and knuckle down to the inevitable reviews of the Beatles catalogue.  For me this is a nostalgic trip since it was my parent’s old LP copy of<em> A Hard Day’s Night </em>that first introduced me to the world of music and spawned a healthy obsession with the Beatles in my two brothers and me.  The problem with being a Beatles fan these days is that it is considered “cooler” to say that you hate the Beatles just because of their immense popularity, so you often run across people who will laugh in your face when you express a love of the band.  However, these very vocal Beatles haters are almost invariably people who have never really listened to their albums and are judging them simply on the likes of their rudimentary early hits and the ever-present albatross “Yellow Submarine”.  I do not condone this hatred for the sake of being different, but neither do I condone those who hold up the Beatles as sacred cows.  In my opinion the Beatles were indeed an amazing band but not everything they produced was the equal of their many masterpieces.<br><br>This leads me neatly into my review of<em> Please Please Me,</em> the Beatles debut album.  It’s hard to believe that the music on this album can be as bad as the grotty cover art but its pretty much achieves this feat.  Save a couple of good tracks, the songs on<em> Please Please Me </em>are at best forgettable, at worst excruciating.  The Beatles were not yet household names when they made this record and the desire to make them into stars lead to George Martin railroading the band into recording a version of “How Do You Do It”, later a hit for Gerry and the Pacemakers, intended for release as the Beatles debut single.  Thankfully, the band (whose enthusiasm for the song was minimal) managed to convince Martin that their own composition “Love Me Do” was a better choice.  Still, listening to the accompanying album reveals that the Beatles at this stage were largely as unworthy of mass devotion as Gerry and the Pacemakers.  With a low budget and a desire to find an audience, the majority of<em> Please Please Me </em>is predictable, easily pigeon-holed pop.  Lennon and McCartney were still developing as songwriters and the eight songs they contribute are largely flimsy and syrupy (although for an act to write that much of their own materiel and not rely on professional songwriters was a major achievement in those days).  The remaining six songs are covers and are mostly equally weak.<br><br>Still,<em> Please Please Me </em>at least opens well with an enjoyable slice of early Beatles, McCartney’s “I Saw Her Standing There”.  Its roots very much in 50s rock ‘n’ roll, “I Saw Her Standing There” leans more towards the commercial sound of Bill Haley than the rawer wail of Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis et al, but working with the commercial restrictions placed upon them the band have created a strong opening track designed to get the listeners on their feet from the word go.  Sadly, they do very little afterwards to keep the listeners from collapsing into the nearest armchair. <em> Please Please Me </em>leans heavily on the slower paced numbers and this initial burst of energy is not regained until the climactic cover of “Twist and Shout”.<br><br>Lennon takes up lead vocals for “Misery”, a mid-paced shuffle with a downbeat “lost love” lyric.  The shortest song on the album, “Misery” does very little to impress the listener, although it is infinitely preferable to the run of cover versions that follow in its wake.  This particularly weak spot begins with “Anna (Go To Him)”, a cover of a song by Arthur Alexander.  An old-fashioned tear jerker with a plodding pace is bolstered by Lennon’s admirable croon but the song lacks energy and the initially energised listener sinks further into his/her armchair.  The longing for another uptempo danceable number is not satisfied by the tuneless, country-tinged cover of the Cookies “Chains”.  George Harrison takes his first lead vocal but sounds totally bored by the whole affair and the backing vocals only serve to drag the whole song further out of tune.  Surprisingly, then, it is Ringo’s song that works best of these three covers, although that is not really down to Mr. Starr.  Rather, it is the fact that “Boys” is the type of upbeat number the album has been crying out for.  A cover of a song by The Shirelles, “Boys” is by no means a great song but Ringo’s flat vocal performance at least seems to be rooted in a sense of real enjoyment and whoops and screams from the rest of the band in the background make “Boys” a more tempting prospect than its dour predecessors.  <br><br>Lennon’s “Ask Me Why” blends seamlessly into the cover songs, betraying the fact that the band were not yet developed as confident songwriters in their own right and had to rely on the styles of other songs on which to base their own compositions.  “Ask Me Why” is another honey-dripping slow number about love with embarrassing backing vocals that go “I love you, woo-woo-woo-woo”.  Only the fact that it is an original composition makes “Ask Me Why” more interesting than the cover versions it follows.  Slightly better is the band’s first big hit “Please Please Me”.  A little out of tune, the song nevertheless has a couple of neat little catchy bits (“I don’t wanna sound complaining but you know there’s always rain in my heart, In-my-heart…”) which punctuate its overall dragging pace.  There’s a famous story that after the band recorded “Please Please Me” George Martin told them “You’ve just ,made your first number one”.  And sure enough, in January 1963 the song climbed the charts to number…… 2! Oh well.<br><br>The wailing harmonica-based blues of “Love Me Do” only reached number 17 when it was released as the first single from<em> Please Please Me </em>but it has nevertheless gone on to become the most famous song from the album.  Its rawness means that it stands out from the more sugary pop of its album counterparts, although apparently it was “too raw” for the record buying public and this accounts for its poor sales.  Better than the majority of the album, “Love Me Do” is still no masterpiece.  Its repetitive lyrics are perhaps some of the weakest of the band’s career, although they help retain the simplicity the song strives for.  The limited success of the track is almost entirely down to Lennon’s piercingly shrill harmonica breaks without which the song would be little more than a playground chant.<br><br>McCartney’s “PS I Love You” is the sappiest track on the whole record.  A love song in the form of a letter, it was apparently a very popular song amongst the female fans.  Hardly surprising, since screaming teenage girls are the clear target market for this banal crap.  It sits comfortably beside another Shirelles cover, the painful “Baby, It’s You”.  This insincerely performed mess of a track is the only thing that saves the caterwauling of “Chains” from being the album’s worst song.  The track relies heavily on a “sha-la-la-la-la-la-la” backing vocal, which can never be a good thing, although it is the hilarious croon of “cheat, cheat” which really pushes the song from the awful into the laughable.<br><br>Harrison gets a second shot at lead vocals on the Beatles original “Do You Want to Know a Secret” but this time blows it by sounding completely unconfident, despite some endearing twangs of Liverpudlian (“Do you promise not to<em> tell)</em>.  Like the majority of the formulaic love songs on<em> Please Please Me,</em> “Do You Want to Know a Secret” covers no new ground and draws to a close without inspiring any strong emotions either way.  The amusingly dramatic “A Taste of Honey” (a cover of the theme from the film of the same name), passes with similar indifference although it does have a pleasingly sinister edge that is missing in the straight forward “I love you, you love me” cobblers of its predecessors.<br><br>The final original composition is Lennon’s “There’s a Place”, a little known Beatles song which sounds Buddy Holly-ish in its chirpy determinism.  It falls victim to vague tendencies towards being out of tune but is altogether a better track than the majority of those which went before it.  Still, it is blown out of the water by the cover of the Isley Brothers “Twist and Shout”.  Although it sounds tamer than expected in its opening moments, the moment Lennon’s vocals come in you know you’re in for a treat.  A ragingly hoarse shriek which peaks in the middle when the band scream their way into the final verses.  This massively energetic party number will drag the listener from their chair back onto their feet, just in time for the album’s end!<br><br>_Please Please Me_ is the start of an incredible story.  The embryonic talents on display here would go on to create some incredible work in the future but sadly little of this promise is evident from this album.  Relying too heavily on clichéd love songs and safe impersonations of other artists,<em> Please Please Me </em>is a dated record and offers practically nothing worth savouring.  If you’re trying to convince Beatles haters to give them another try, make sure you conceal this album’s existence.</span>,<span>It might be strange to describe a debut album as transitional, but curiously that’s exactly what<em> Please Please Me </em>was. Previously used to the dynamics of live performance, the Beatles were clearly struggling to capture the essence of that sound on this album. Lennon himself put it perfectly, “In Liverpool, Hamburg and other dance halls what we generated was fantastic, where we played straight rock and there was nobody to touch us in Britain. As soon as we made it, we made it, but the edges were knocked off.” The studio wasn’t the only thing to knock the edges off either. The choice of material was questionable to say the least. In the worst move of his entire career, George Martin decided that Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Elvis Presley covers were off limits. Also bafflingly omitted was the excellent stage favourite “Some Other Guy”. Thus the finished product is a rather bastardised view of the Beatles' early work. Instead of hearing cracking cover versions of the artists that originally inspired them, (consigned to the impressive<em> Live at the BBC </em>album) we’re presented with a largely subdued selection of ballad-esque teen romance. Not that this is evident from the sprightly rock of the opener “I Saw Her Standing There”, whose fresh upbeat flavour makes up for its lyrical simplicity. The major hit single “Please Please Me” is another triumph of arrangement with pockets of isolated drumming and harmonica adding an inventive feel to the track, while the more minor hit “Love Me Do” also relies heavily on harmonica breaks to provide its catchiness. The album’s fourth and final key song is a very strong cover of “Twist and Shout”. With Lennon finally let loose on some raw rock ‘n’ roll vocals and the Beatles providing powerful, driving support, the track instantly became a virtual Beatles original and served as proof of just what they could do with rock ‘n’ roll when given the chance. Unfortunately, there’s considerably less power in loping semi-rockers like “Anna” and “Baby It’s You”, although “P.S. I Love You” shows a slight glimpse of McCartney’s romantic abilities. Similarly, “There’s a Place” was a rough and ready precursor to Lennon’s later explorations of the mind. In many ways,<em> Please Please Me </em>is similar to<em> Sgt. Pepper </em>in that its overall effect was far greater than its actual quality. Most importantly, the album’s eight originals started to make many groups consider writing their own material. Beatlemania gathered pace when a cover of the album’s “Do You Want to Know a Secret?” plus the Lennon/McCartney giveaways “Bad to Me”, “Hello Little Girl” and “I’ll Keep You Satisfied” all made the top ten for other artists. This was in addition to their own chart toppers “From Me to You” and “She Loves You”. With confidence and momentum rapidly growing, their second album later in the year would prove far more sophisticated and richer than this surprisingly primitive and lightweight debut.</span>,<span>Nice for starters. Ex-WW1 Brigadier-General George Martin's insistence that these laddish ale slurping layabouts wear their collars buttoned makes dividends for Rock n' Roll. Personally, my Beatles induction came via other peoples' hazy memoirs, my own family's love affair with music limited to piss-drunk uncles roaring ""Roll Out the Barrel"" at weddings; so much so, the presence of latter works only dampening recollections on what kind of grip this music had on 1963 - pitch perfect harmonies, tiny little amps rattling under the strain of a cramped studio, professionally handled covers and originals, such as pop masterpiece 'I Saw Her Standing There', droll droning skiffle 'Love Me Do', setting the ball rolling for music's most accomplished genre. The Fantastic Four or whatever they were called never really did a bad album, few of their contemporaries can claim such honours.</span>,<span>John should have gotten some NyQuil for this one.</span>,<span>I was listening to The Beatles damn near religiously as a kid, I heard this album more times than I could count but the last time I had was over 5 years ago so revisiting this was great. People like to overlook it cause it sounded more normal and it's not much compared to their later works but it's still great music, and easily the best thing to come out in 1963 and the only thing close that isn't jazz is their other album. some of the best pop rock that's truly poppy, no psychedelia. Conceptually it's lacking but that's not what I listen to this album for and if you are then just listen to sgt peppers or magical mystery tour. A lot of feel good love songs with a late summer early fall or spring vibe. Best songs are I Saw Her Standing There, There's A Place, Please Please Me, Twist and Shout<br><br>I wouldn't revisit the whole album again but individual songs definitely</span>,<span>Paul McCartney and John Lennon were, evidently, born music geniuses. Their musicianship grew a great deal over time, but they already had a hint of something special in 1963. I'm no expert in early 60's pop, but from what I can tell, this is pretty good pop music for 1963. The production is pretty good on most of these tracks and the chord progressions aren't as boring as most 50's and early 60's pop on some of these tracks. That being said, I only gave this 3.0 stars because it's not something I ever care to hear again. It's good 1963 pop, but it's still pretty basic pop.</span>"
"<span>Straight from Hamburg, live in the studio. ""Please Please Me"" is a good example of a band that was already tight from playing live before the debut album. Although Ringo was a newcomer. He fit right into the band, from the same Liverpool scene.</span>,<span>Please Please Me, the whipping boy for most music ""experts"" as far as The Beatles go. Sure it isn't the eastern infused, ground breaking  record SGT Peppers was, nor is it the psychedelic trip that The Magical Mystery Tour has to offer but it's certainly from the same band. It has a feeling of innocence to it scattered with covers and sugary rhythms and grooves that not even the major cynical person can deny (though they will claim there is no good music on here until they're blue in the face). <br><br>Please Please Me though a sugary pop sounding record that is relatively safe, it is littered with dark and quite sombre moments. The track Misery a prime example Lennons raw lyrics -<br><br>""Send her back to me<br>Cos everyone can see<br>Without her I will be in misery"" <br><br>Even on tracks that simply get covered on this have a raw element to them, Baby It's You -<br><br>""many nights go by,<br>I sit alone at home and I cry over you.""<br><br>When you hear these sort of lyrics it isn't quite the happy sugary landscape that you'd imagine when you hear people talk about this record.<br><br>Unfortunately there are quite a few duds on this thing, track Chains for me is a real lack lustre pop song, The Beatles adding no real groove to this song at all. It feels out of place rhythmically in the sequencing of the album, and as a stand alone track it doesn't offer much at all. <br>The track Boys though not a bad song by any stretch of the imagination feels a little tiresome towards the end. But non of these for me are the worst track on here.<br><br>The main offender on this album is A Taste Of Honey this IS a track that feels tiresome, the music behind is remotely interesting. But the vocals just feel so tiresome and forced. This is one of the only tracks I could accuse of being filler on this album, it just feels easy and almost laughably bad. Not to worry though the band soon get back on form with the undeniable groove and charm of the track There's a Place. It's a track filled with warmth and innocence and is really quite enjoyable.<br><br>Ask Me Why is a groovy little number and has an undeniable innocence to it which feels refreshing, and just has some harmonies on it that you can't help but appreciate. I'd really not be surprised if this track would help influence bands like The Beach Boys a little further down the line. And straight after we get the title track Please Please Me and it just takes this notion up a notch, an undeniable groove as the harmonies just get layered in a careful non offensive manner and it's just hard not to enjoy the essence and vibe of these tracks. <br><br>Love Me Do is a track that takes the harmonica this album is littered with and really just allows Lennon to own it, for me is a track foreshadowing the future outcome of the band in a way. Lennon and McCartney working as a team in a way they only know how. The melody is very strong and the singing just as strong, it's a great track. <br><br>To round things off we get my favourite track on here, Twist and Shout. Sure that's the easy choice that most people go to from this album, and I won't apologise for this being my favourite track. Lennon's vocals are just filled with passion and belief for the music they're making (hell he even fucks up his vocal chords on the recording), the harmonies from the rest of the band just makes this feel like a complete team effort of a recording and is really hard not to love. And that for me is why I really like Please Please Me, it's a clear team effort from a band who just want a chance, and they pull through with a lot of undeniably great tracks, sure it has its rough patches but it isn't the shambles a lot of people make it out to be.</span>,<span>There's a temptation to consider <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> debut album as an absolute game changer, the high is fair enough until you take into consideration their rapid evolution and the albums that followed. Is it really that impressive all these decades later?<br><br>Released at a time when albums were effectively tools to help promote an act's new single, rather than the other day around, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> does sound of its time, yet because it's <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong>, there's an innate charm and sense of purpose which allows it to stand apart from the pack.<br><br>Another thing to consider is that the majority of pop acts in the early 60s by and large didn't write their own material, yet on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, over half of the fourteen tracks were Lennon and McCartney originals. This was the album that started to turn that particular tide. <br><br>As an album of great pop music, I really like <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. Sure, there's the odd number which isn't as impressive, but those generally tend to be covers, and when you consider the average quality of pop albums at the time, it's still an enormous achievement, even when in the grand scheme of things it's a lesser <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> album. And that it's an album that features evergreen classics like ""I Saw Her Standing There"", the title track, ""Love Me Do"" and closes with a rip-roaring version of ""Twist and Shout"", only goes to emphasise the size of their later achievements.<br><br>Is <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> a game changer? It really all depends on what you want to get out of the game.</span>,<span>I have listened to this album, and I have found that it is a classic original album. As some of you might know not all music is perfect. I think the lyrics are poorly written. Most of the songs relate to the same thing:Girls: Now some of you might think,ok other bands today relate to girls. This is the point:NOTHING HAS CHANGED: Which goes to show you why I like bands that think outside of the box. You are probably thinking why did I give this album a 3.5 rating. Well my freinds, only the old music is the same. Some of the music later in the album are individual, and think outside the box. To sum my review up it is a classic. Remember to give my review a thumbs up and thanks for reading.</span>,<span><strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong> is far from being one of The Beatles' most consistent or brilliant works but does a good job of capturing the energy and spirit of four young British lads on the cusp of superstardom. Original compositions like ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", and ""Love Me Do"" display the innate talent possessed by the Lennon-McCartney songwriting duo when it comes to writing a hit pop song. The band's performances of cover songs, such as ""Chains"", ""Baby It's You"", and ""Twist and Shout"" show off their abundant youthful energy that is the central catalyst through the entirety of the album.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">8/10</em></span>,<span>I wouldn’t listen to this debut album often, hasn’t aged as well as their mid to late 60s releases. The lyrics don’t appeal to me on an emotional level, I find the writing a bit cheesy and dated. However as I was told by a couple of commenters on my blog, The Beatles were considered groundbreaking in the early 60s compared to what other groups were doing. <br>I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, and Twist and Shout (cover) are Beatles classics and timeless for the pop melodies.</span>,<span>On 11 Sep 1962, George Martin woke up early as usual, ready to go to work. Martin had worked as a producer from the early 50’s, mostly concentrating on classical music but also doing some pop, spoken word and novelty records. Today he was working with a band called The Beatles. Despite originally describing the band as “rather unpromising”, he had since given the band a chance, recording two singles with them. “Love me Do” and “Please Please Me”, which had reached #19 and #1, respectively on the charts. Realising that pop groups had a remarkable short lifespan, Martin wanted to capitalise on the success of these hit singles and booked the band to record an LP. This recording session would ultimately change his life, pop music and pop culture forever. <br><br>By this stage the band had been playing together for years and had built a cult following down the Cavern Club. This album is a best-off from that period; fourteen songs selected by the band themselves from their ever-increasing live reportage. They had a unique sound, influenced by rock roll, R &amp; B and pop music. Some of the songs show the Lennon/McCartney song writing partnership full of promise however with room for improvement. On the other hand, songs like “I Saw Her Standing There” and “Please Please Me” still rate as Beatles classics and still form part of McCartney’s live set list at times.<br><br>The covers are well-performed; as you would expect after years of practise. I particular like the fact The Beatles covered the all girl groups. The Shirlles are covered  twice on this record to great effect with “Baby It’s You” and “Boys¹<br>The rip roaring sound of Lennon’s voice cracking in “Twist and Shout” is legendary – one of the great rock roll songs of all-time.<br><br> For the lucky few who got to see them play live in the early years, nothing will replace that, for the rest of us this is a great historical document of those gigs that period as well as a bloody good pop record.</span>,<span>Mógłbym tym słodzić herbatę, gdybym używał cukru.</span>"
"<span>Please Please Me's very important to rock history obviously, but simply looking at it as it is, it's a very well-made album, especially for its time. The original compositions on this album are amazing, it only shows how fantastic Lennon and McCartney were as songwriters from the get-go. The youthful and joyfully quick I Saw Her Standing There is a great highlight, as well as the completely different Misery, a precursor to the moody pieces Lennon would write later on. It's not shocking to me that this album was the one that kind of popularized rock to the public, all the songs contain an endearingly excited energy and are very catchy. The only downside is that endearing might come across to some as cheesy nowadays, but I think the covers would seem cheesier. Don't get me wrong, the covers are pretty great too, though some are better than others. Ringo's cover of Boys and Lennon's cover of Anna sound kinda awkward, but it's apparent that they really admired those songs and took great care when covering them. Then there's Twist and Shout, which is like the end-all-be-all of cover songs. Lennon's passionate and raspy vocals (thanks to a long day of recording) and the pure energy of the cover overall is really something that can't be done again. Overall, it's worth a listen for its importance, even if the sound could be too cheesy or dated for some. It's a quick and enjoyable listen anyhow.</span>,<span>A one, two, three, four .. and jump right into it boys!  Good grab of your attention.<br><br>Hearing some nice piano and guitar fills, and oh! harmonica too!  Love these fresh young voices again.  Mmm, the debut album factor strikes again ..  Ringo sets the pace, tight!<br><br>Great job singing on Boys Ringo!  George is really ringing in places on these songs, but he's just a little low in the mix.  Should production be another part of album ratings?<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Ask Me Why</em> is a little muzaky.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do</em> and the harmonica sound GREAT on this Mono release.  My first Mono CD!  It plays on the surround speakers, but it's the whole mix on them.  Did Martin maybe ask the guys to step it up a pace on this one?<br><em class=""rymfmt"">P.S.

Love Me Do is a toe-tapper but the rest of it has now gravitated into grotesque grandpa music. Time to consign to the history bin.</span>,<span>Nerokas, omaperäinen, taidokas, älykäs, klassikkomainen.</span>,<span>Well, you have to start out somewhere. In 1963, The Beatles released this, their first album. I doubt most people back then would have thought this band would become the most acclaimed, celebrated, and popular group of all time. It's very of-its-time and shows little indication of the experimentation of their later work. It's simply a batch of pop songs: seven originals, seven covers. <br><br>It starts out with one of the most recognizable intros to an album ever. Paul McCartney counts to four and then ""I Saw Her Standing There"" begins. It is the most rock of all the songs on here, and the best. The raw energy that was supposedly present in their Cavern Club shows is present here. George Harrison tries his first guitar solo, and while it is clearly amateurish, it does not weigh down the quality of the track. <br><br>The title track, ""Please Please Me"", was the Beatles first number one hit. It follows the pop formula well. Love-themed lyrics, simple melody, catchy chorus, and short duration. It is much better than their first single ""Love Me Do"", however. ""Love Me Do"" is very repetitive and childish; clearly the work of inexperienced songwriting. There are only twenty words in the song, and the whole thing sounds like a nursery rhyme. That's a shame, because the B-side ""P.S. I Love You"" is a very pleasant love ballad with nothing but acoustic guitars and maracas. <br><br>The other originals range from mediocre (""Misery"", ""Ask Me Why"") to actually pretty good (""There's A Place"", which features the best lyrics on the album). <br><br>Of the covers, the best is ""Twist and Shout"". Originally done by the Isley Brothers, the Beatles bring more energy and John Lennon's throat-shredding vocals. ""Baby It's You"" has very good harmonies and a celesta solo from George Martin. Unfortunately, the rest of the covers are not as good and add little to either the album or the songs.<br><br>It's a very naive, quaint album and shows little signs that The Beatles were to become called ""the greatest band of all time"". With the next few releases, that would change.</span>,<span>I originally gave this a 6 but I realized their genius already shines through in this album, despite the occasional cheesy moments (""Do You Want to Know a Secret""; ""P.S. I Love You"").<br><br>Lennon already knew how to write a compelling, emotional song, as shown in two of this album's hidden gems: ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"". He also gives a stellar vocal performance on ""Anna"" and ""Twist and Shout"". <br><br>Meanwhile, Paul shows that he already knows how to write with two of my favorites: the title track, which is an undeniably catchy and energetic tune, with that simple but effective guitar line and ""I Saw Her Standing There"", a terrific opener.<br><br>People often complain that this album is too light and corny but, come on, it was 1963! What did you expect? This is good stuff.</span>,<span>This album is surreal, not because it is great or anything, far from it. But because this band would go on to release Rubber Soul in 2 years. 2 years! I dont think anyone could have predicted that they had so much in them after listening to this debut. Its very generic 60's pop rock, really hard to distinguish them for the rest of the scene at the time. I cant stand ""love me do"" anymore, and i never found ""twist and shout"" to be all that good. The rest of it is just very passable rock with heavy blues influences. Its decent to play in the background, but its a 30 minute album that really fails to grab my attention. <br><br>Standout is ""i saw her standing there"".</span>"
"<span>Hot trash, outside of a few songs. Without the lyrics, the songs would sound virtually the same, and with all of the tracks being under three minutes, it sure is easy to space out in the middle of them.</span>,<span>Please Please Me makes perfect sense in the context of The Beatles careers, but also feels weirdly out of place. The music is far more lightweight than almost everything that came after it, and a few tracks are straight-R&amp;B with hardly any of the rock/power-pop the band would be/was famous for.<br><br>This is also a case of the best songs on the album being the most well known. ""Please Please Me"" revolves around a harmonica riff and has a surprisingly strong melody and short instrumental fills. I especially love the call-and-response prechorus where Lennon trades ""come on"" with McCartney and Harrison.  ""I Saw Her Standing There"" kicks things off with a bang, speeding along faster than pretty much the entire album, featuring another strong melody that gave a glimpse at what was to come from the band's later career.<br><br>""Love Me Do"" has never been a favorite of mine, but I understand why it was a hit when it was released, as it's a fun little ditty that bounces along quite nicely (fun note: I saw Sir McCartney in concert, and he played this song and then juxtaposed it with his most recent hit, ""FourFiveSeconds,"" which was released over 50 years later). ""P.S. I Love You"", the B-side of The Beatles's first single, isn't as strong as the album's best tracks, but has a nice little hook. McCatney's little add-ons in the final minute are also cute, and there's really no other word to describe them. Lastly, ""Twist and Shout"" doesn't really need an introduction. It's one of the best vocal performances on a Beatles album, and its just well-composed, stopping for those building ""oh""s to jump right into the chorus.<br><br>The rest of the album isn't bad, but it's somewhat generic, especially for The Beatles. ""Ask Me Why"", ""Baby It's You"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"", and ""A Taste of Honey"" all feel somewhat phoned-in. While definitely listenable and arguably catchy, none of them belong in the same room as the band's later work. ""Chains"", ""There's a Place"", and ""Boys"" are somewhat better, as these songs' faster pace gives them a boost of energy that, say, ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" lacks completely. <br><br>On a final note, if you want to see what I mean when I say Please Please Me is 'light' and With the Beatles is 'dark', give back-to-back listens to ""Misery"" and ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"" from the latter album. Both are piano-led cover songs, but have fundamentally different tones. ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"" drops the piano down an octave and ups the volume to create a deep feeling when combined with the vocal arrangement. ""Misery"", meanwhile, plays it as a straightforward pop tune in the same vein of ""P.S. I Love You"", with higher-octave keyboards and Lennon practically singing on his tiptoes.<br><br>While my least favorite Beatles album (excluding Yellow Submarine), Please Please Me holds up rather well, and as I say on most Beatles reviews, almost any band would kill to have recorded one of these songs. It's bizarre to think that, as good as Please Please Me is, The Beatles only moved upwards from here.</span>,<span>Obviously this is no Rubber Soul or Revolver, but there's a certain appeal and charm to Please Please Me that makes it highly enjoyable. The songs on here are mostly rock &amp; roll covers or songs about teenage romances with silly lyrics, but it has something endearing about it; there's a certain spontaneousness and humanity that I kinda miss on the later Beatles albums, where the songs sometimes are too precisely performed.<br><br>Plus, there are some amazing melodies and songs on here. I Saw Here Standing There kicks off the album with a bang and Love Me Do and P.S. I Love You contain great melodies, despite their incredibly silly lyrics. An album I enjoy for what it is: a solid early 1960's pop album. Just don't compare it too much to their later stuff.</span>,<span>The beatles debut...it's noticeable how much better they got when George martin got a hold of them (check out the decca audition tape where Epstein's overly safe choice of material in the face of the labels indifference cost them) Instead a producer who actually liked and cared about them was able to get them to simply produce their live set quickly in the studio and with a minimum of fuss.<br><br>Starr's sturdy playing is the next improvement to note as the band built around his solid backbeat a fair mix of material including girl group pop,rare RnB,skiffle,50s rocknroll,showtunes and of course some of these musics are framed in their own writing too. <br><br>Its undeniably lennons band,his vocal performances on ""anna"" and ""baby it's you"" are jawdroppingly good and that's before we get to the closing rave up of ""twist and shout"". George is clearly being marketed as the baby of the band and he does a decent job throughout the album. McCartney's harmonies are brought forth more on the remaster and you can hear his and lennons love of buddy holly and roy orbison on the title track and ""ps I love you"". His bass playing is genuinely excited throughout (check out the bottom end he powers on ""Boys"".)<br><br>A good debut album,in retrospect it really does feel like the start of something special...even if it didn't on release.</span>,<span>George Martin's production is not yet immaculate and the boys sound pretty rough n' ready (was recorded in a matter of hours) and this is possibly their least consistent album (unless you count ""Yellow Submarine"", which you really shouldn't) but it's undeniable that there's already tangible magic within the grooves of songs like ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""There's A Place"", ""PS I Love You"" and the title track.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">“Last night I said these words to my girl…”</em><br><br>Right then, ‘Please Please Me’ is The Beatles’ most harmless album, and that isn’t necessarily a good thing. The Beatles will forever be known for making daring records, even ones from the first half of their mere ten-year span (you hear that? It doesn’t matter if you got a Distinction in your Media Studies, these guys accomplished more in ten years and you ever will). Oh man, classic click bait, I advertise this as a Beatles review, but it’s actually a rant about media studies students.<br><br>Nevertheless, this album is more ‘of the time’ but with some really strong compositions that make it a great album. And hey, compositionally it isn’t even anywhere near as strong as what they’d do on the next album, there are only a few truly great songs, but in 1963 this was pretty spectacular. One of their early signature hits, ‘I Saw Her Standing There’ kicks off the album pretty powerfully, a great ‘this is a rock album’ opener. The two other songs that make this a strong album are the title track, and the closer, their cover of ‘Twist and Shout’, which features one of John’s strongest ever vocal performances. Also on this album is ‘Love Me Do’, a perfectly fine song, but not necessarily one of my favourites, a bit too old-fashioned.<br><br>The Beatles were already showing off at this point.

The songs on here are some of the finest that they'd play. The interesting thing about the Beatles' first album is that the music itself isn't as groundbreaking as the fact that a rock and roll band as tight and writing most of their own songs was able to take over the planet so quickly. When you compare this album to contemporary albums from Britain, from Herman's Hermits, Dave Clark Five, Gerry and the Pacemakers, this doesn't in any way dwarf them. It sets the pace but it doesn't blow them away.<br><br>You could call them a 1960s version of a boy band. There were all the elements of that. But they weren't the first. However, their ability to write songs and chose fitting covers really led them to the success of this first album. It flows well. There's some variation in speed but not much in the overall style. The production is minimalist but that allows the songs to show through instead of confusing the listener like many idols' songs did of the era. The songs aren't going to knock your socks of in their reach and topics. Let's be honest the Beatles didn't really sing about anything other than love in their first five albums.<br><br>Pros: 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Do You Want to Know a Secret', 'There's a Place', 'Twist and Shout'<br><br>Cons: 'Misery', 'Boys' are pretty much filler.</span>,<span>So this is the first beatles studio album and it took the least studio time to record it from all the other albums they did later, it was made very fast. It includes stuff they played in the cavern ,about half are covers with the most popular one being twist and shout, Lennon's voice was literally suffered to record this number.  The opening song is one of the best openers ever for an album and by far the best song in this album. Although the song's bass line isnt that original like many think, it's directly taken from Chuck Berry's ''talking about you'' as Paul admitted later.  Anyway good album  with fine songs but few really standout.  To this day this is my least favorite beatle studio album if you dont count yellow submarine but still i like it and play it from time to time  <br><br>Highlights: I saw her standing there, Love me do (their first hit single) and twist and shout</span>"
"<span>Most likely the best early Beatles album. The singles on this album would help the Beatles become the most popular rock group in the United Kingdom. Contains quite a few early Beatles favorites but also has a lot of filler but this was also the beginning to much more creative and innovative music in the future.</span>,<span>I think one reason people don't like this album a whole lot is because of what would come later on. Obviously we're not listening to <a title=""[Album206]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/revolver-5/"" class=""album"">Revolver</a> or <a title=""[Album12]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/abbey-road-83/"" class=""album"">Abbey Road</a> here, and if you're going to compare this album to those you will come away disappointed. What we do have, though, is a very pleasant album with some really good songs mixed in with some junk. This includes a few originals (I'm looking at you, ""Ask Me Why""), but also some unnecessary covers (yes, ""Twist and Shout"" is an exception). ""Boys"" just shouldn't have happened, let's be honest. But when an album has ""Love Me Do"", ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Please Please Me"", I can't hate. <br><br>Favorite tracks: I Saw Her Standing There, Misery, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Baby It's You, Do You Want to Know a Secret, Twist and Shout</span>,<span>One could argue that only simpletons write this off as simple, but to my mind only people who want to sound grandiose and pretentious pretend that it isn't. This is nowhere <em class=""rymfmt"">near</em> as good as their later albums, and anyone who tells you otherwise is not to be trusted. Sure the album is sprinkled liberally with catchy melodies, but the vocal performances are perfunctory rather than exciting, the lyrics are largely trite, and the arrangements can't help sounding remarkably uninspired in light of, uh, pretty much all pop music since. The bulk of this album was famously recorded in less than a day and by god it shows.</span>,<span>The only song worth checking out is the band's version of ""Twist and Shout"", to this day popular on country weddings and dancings.</span>,<span>With these words 'Please Please Me' introduces us to -and you can quote me on that- the greatest band in music history.<br>After many years of building up a solid fanbase through -at the time- stunning little live performances, The Beatles finally made a record deal with Parlophone while being managed by Brian Epstein and pushed by George Martin. <br>But The Beatles on this record are not the regular Beatles. Before they changed their style to a suit wearing and polite young Pop group due to Brian Epstein, they were known for a much rawer and Rock-like appearence. Leather jackets, swearing, eating on-stage; all these by today standards pretty lame aspects of their appearence needed to abate to push them more into the mainstream. <br>Thanks to this, this early time period is often named their 'naive' days or -even much bolder- their boyband years. <br>Even though the songs are often pure schmaltz and their appearence further underline the superficial perception that many modern music listerns get from this band in their early days, this perception couldn't be further away from the truth.<br>Not just Buddy Holly was an influence for The Beatles. Chuch Berry and Elvis were inspirations for them, too. Both rule breakers and -again for the time- pretty controversial popular figures. Something The Beatles should become later on, too.<br>But the signs are already on this album. From pretty raw singing on 'Twist and Shout' to the suggestive lyrics on 'Please Please Me', they showed their rebellious nature in little doses on their early output. But if you really want to get, why this band was already considered rebellious, you can go watch some early interviews from them. Not just George Martin was impressed by their humor to say at least.<br>But let's get away from these historical things for a second and let us talk about the most important thing of every album: the music.<br>I already mentioned some of their influences, but musically most notably are The Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry.<br>You can easily hear these influences in the schmalzy nature of the songs and fine harmonies (The Everly Brothers), the colorful instrumentation and memorable melodies (Buddy Holly) and the top-notch guitar and bass playing (Chuck Berry).<br>A huge part of this album are cover versions. And unlike many other acts, especially in the time when this album was released, they gave these songs a whole new personality.<br>'Anna (Go to Him)' is one of my favorite underrated Beatles songs and 'Twist and Shout' is a classic example of great cover versions of already great songs.<br>But sadly the only song sang by Ringo is also the only weaker one, namely 'Boys'. Compared to the rest of the album, it just falls flat due to the weaker vocals.<br>But anyway, the more impressive part of this album are the songs by the band themself.<br>From classics like 'Please Please Me' and 'Love Me Do' to my personal favorites 'I Saw Her Standing There', 'Do You Want to Know a Secret' and 'There's a Place' (the only not-love song on here), they already wrote amazing Pop/ Rock in their early days.<br>And even though it gets sound-wise a little bit repetetive, they offer so many great melodies, refrains and instrumental parts that I just can't criticize this album too much.<br>Verdict:<br>Yes, this album is kind of dated, but historically important. Yes, it is repetetive, but never bad. Yes, it is in their amazing/ unmatched discography a little bit underwhelming, but still damn impressive. And not just for the time it was released.<br><br>4 stars</span>,<span>Is there a better way to begin an album than a simple ""one two three FOUR""? ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is, for me, the quintessential early Beatles track, I almost prefer it to its single partner ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"". ""Misery"" is less frenetic, and it's a good song, but it pales in comparison to the opener, though I do like that doo-wop ""la la la la la"" at the end. ""Anna (Go To Him)"" has some nice lilting ""aaAAAAAAnna"" harmonies, ironic that the lead is sung by the guy who would later write ""Run For Your Life"". ""Boys"" is a return to form form the lackluster ""Chains"", and the boilerplate ""Ask Me Why"" is similarly rescued by the superb title track to end side 1.<br><br>""Love Me Do"" is just the slightest bit insipid, I'd have dug a bit deeper into the catalog if I was little Johnny in <a title=""[Artist1347]"" href=""/artist/bad-company"" class=""artist"">Bad Company</a>'s ""Shooting Star"". Really getting your money's worth off that five-finger discount harmonica, eh, John? This isn't even a live album and I can still hear the screaming that would no doubt accompany ""P.S. I Love You"". ""Baby It's You"" is another ballad with slightly more bite. ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" is probably worthy of side one, it's easily the best track of side two so far. ""A Taste of Honey"" is another slice of balladry saved by the lead-harmony dynamic and George Harrison's guitar work. ""There's A Place"" is like an appetizer track, getting us ready to rock before ""Twist and Shout"" comes in to end the record on a mighty commotion.<br><br>Key tracks: ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", ""Twist and Shout""</span>,<span>thrasher2809's Beatles Overanalysis #1<br><br>And so, at 3:30 in the morning on a Thursday, it begins. An idea I've been kicking around for a while. ""There's very little in the way of conventional critique of the Beatles that hasn't already been done by someone smarter and more literate than you,"" I thought to myself, ""so perhaps the thing to do would be to write little 'things I noticed' note thingamajigs for every song. That way there'll be a stricter emphasis on your personal connection to the album, rather than you just going on about why it's good or what not.""<br><br>And so it shall be. Let's begin. A word of warning: this could get stream-of-consciousness-y.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</strong><br>The bassline for the verses is just fucking nuts. It's nuts. You try playing it and singing like you've been a rock 'n roll singer for your whole life <em class=""rymfmt"">simultaneously</em> and get back to me. The backing harmonies Lennon throws in give the song a slight country feel, which is unusual considering the chords are pure R&amp;B raunch. Harrison's solo is decent but doesn't give much away regarding his potential. His ending the song on an E6add9 chord, however, definitely does. For theory geeks: the I-III-IV-VI progression in the chorus was fairly unusual. You'd hear it again (with the root in minor rather than major) in the Yardbirds' ""For Your Love"" and (in A) in the Animals' cover of ""House of the Rising Sun"".<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Misery</strong><br>There's literally nothing remarkable about this track. Nothing. So let's move on.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Anna (Go to Him)</strong><br>Lennon's first great vocal, even if the lyrics are a bit insipid (though it's a cover and this is 1963, so... y'know). I also like Ringo's off-kilter drumming during the verses and George/Paul's very 50s harmonies during the middle eight. As a song, though, it's just decent.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Chains</strong><br>Apart from being the first lead George vocal (and an all right one at that), there's not a whole lot going on here.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Boys</strong><br>See above, except swap George for Ringo.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Ask Me Why</strong><br>INCREDIBLY harmonically complex for 1963. The verses are full of major sevenths straight out of cool jazz, the chorus has a minor-to-minor change (which flat out didn't happen in rock, period), and the middle eight uses an Orbison-y augmented fifth. Not crazy about the lyrics, but who gives a shit. This here's the first ""whoa there"" moment for the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong><br>Not much to say about this one. It's a nearly perfect pop track. The decision to have Paul sing every word of the verses in E and have Lennon sing the E-Eb-D-C-D-C-A-D-C melody on top of it is pure genius, as is the unaccompanied guitar lick that leads into the chorus.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do</strong><br>I can't stand this track. Moving on.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">P.S. I Love You</strong><br>Not great either, apart from the unexpected chord change at the word ""you"" in the chorus, which is totally ruined by the cheesy as all hell ""you you you"" progression.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Baby It's You</strong><br>Decent, and one of the better covers. Though the idea of mirroring George's solo with a celeste played by G. Martin was a bit... strange.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Do You Want To Know A Secret</strong><br>Great track. Another incredibly busy bassline. The ghostly harmonies work much better here, IMO, than on Anna. You'd think, since George is singing it, it's his track. But it's a Lennon song. George doesn't get a track till their next one, unfortunately. Or fortunately. I dunno where Harrison was as a songwriter in 63.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">A Taste of Honey</strong><br>Horribly schmaltzy.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">There's a Place</strong><br>Not <em class=""rymfmt"">quite</em> as good as Ask Me Why, but in the same camp. The harmonies in the chorus are petrifying.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Twist and Shout</strong><br>Whereas I'd throw this in with the title track as another perfect pop track (though they didn't write it) that isn't remarkable for being unconventional. Everything there is to say about Lennon's vocal on the track has been said already (like, um, the rest of the Beatles' catalogue), but it's still making people get off their asses and move.<br><br>Overall notes:<br>It's an album that deserves merit for being so much better than its contemporaries, and not necessarily for its music. Hence my rating. It's not a masterpiece. It's not even, in my opinion, a great debut. The Beatles' big ""oh shit"" moment was A Hard Day's Night for me, and although there are DEFINITELY gems on both their first two albums, I think the covers are hiding (or maybe not) the fact that they're not quite able to pump out an album of good originals yet. And to be fair, this wasn't much else than a studio recreation of their Hamburg sets anyway. The originals on this album were the ones they'd written on the road, and I <em class=""rymfmt"">guess</em> it's possible the reason some of the covers sound a bit stilted here is because those tracks were showpieces for a concert and not necessarily for the band. I'll put it another way: Primus will occasionally play Master of Puppets live, but I'm not sure anyone wants to hear their ""studio version"" of the track. Perhaps that's a poor analogy. But tracks like Boys, Chains, Misery and A Taste of Honey just don't work at all, and I'd go on record as saying any album with seven good tracks and seven bad tracks is not probably going to be an awe-inspiring piece of music. That being said, you should listen to it for the same reason you should see <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""https://rateyourmusic.com/film/the_killing/"" target=""_blank"">The Killing</a>.

After all, with him in the army, Buddy dead, Chuck getting in trouble, Jerry Lee committing career suicide and rock being watered down into the Frankies and Fabians of the world, rock was dead in the water for a few years. I mean, when your genre's most notable performer is <a title=""[Artist8969]"" href=""/artist/chubby_checker"" class=""artist"">Chubby Checker</a>, that's pretty weak. It's hard for someone today to really comprehend how awesome it must have been when the Beatles <em class=""rymfmt"">did</em> show up. <br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is a midway point between the rockabilly years and what the band themselves would eventually redefine as rock and roll music.

Everything works even though some of it <em class=""rymfmt"">really</em> shouldn't, because the Beatles' music in the early stages was all about urgency, and they barrel forward so boisterously that they just thoughtlessly change the pronouns on ""Boys"" and forge ahead because they're drunk on their own beat (although it must be said that it's a lesser track).<br><br>One thing this reviewer especially likes about this album is that while it is definitely based on the pop music of the time (there are some ""sha la las"" here, thanks to their love of girl groups), it doesn't sound as much dated as a snapshot of history (there <em class=""rymfmt"">is</em> a difference). Time, however, has also showed off the one drawback to the band's enthusiasm, which is that they paint themselves as hopeless romantics, but then emphasize the ""hopeless"" part. You know what I'm talking about. Let's see: love at first sight, heartbreak, heartbreak, heartbreak, kissing girls, devotion, devotion, longing, long distance love, devotion..... you get the idea. The only song that even remotely takes a step away from lovey-dovey stuff is the seminal ""Twist And Shout,"" where John Lennon shouts himself hoarse and puts forth the album's grand finale, and even that song is about dancing with a girl.

The lyrical content holds them back a bit and makes the record feel one-dimensional at times, but they'd make up for it with their stylistic growth until their lyrics caught up with them. Instead, the boys just blaze ahead with enthusiasm, and prove to be a charismatic outfit with an excellent knack for pop, and the result is sometimes kinda goofy, but always intoxicating. When you hear about ""doing so much with so little"" this is what they're talking about.</span>"
"<span>My first album review ever. I will focus on reviewing the selected works of a particular artist in chronological order to progress the artist's growth or downfall.<br><br>Introducing the Beatles was the first Beatles album released in the U.S. Despite some legal issues with its label, the album was a big seller, spending nine consecutive weeks at #2 on the album charts (ironically, it was the group's follow-up record Meet the Beatles that was at #1). How does The Beatles first record fare? Well, as I'm listening to these songs on YouTube, I'll give a quick review of each of the tracks then discuss the album as a whole.<br><br>1. I Saw Her Standing There- Very cheeky song. Paul McCartney's vocals shine early on. Definitely has that 60's rock-and-roll groove. Fun track. 4/5<br><br>2. Misery- Even though the song is about misery on a woman, it's still a groovin' track that showcases the early bond of John and Paul's brilliant singing and songwriting. 3.5/5<br><br>3. Anna- John Lennon's vocals shine in what is otherwise a generic, dull love song. 2.5/5<br><br>4. Chains- Well, that was fun. I dig the harmonies, the figurative language of being in bondage, and the bluesy, folk production. Special note is the song being co-written by Carole King. 4.5/5<br><br>5. Boys- Ringo Starr was known for singing the weirder Beatles tunes, and Boys is no exception. I don't get the reasoning for them constantly flipping between genders of the song, but it's got an upbeat production that's hard to dislike, along with Ringo's fine vocals. 3/5<br><br>6. Love Me Do- Dude, that harmonica was beast! Plus the beat's catchy, the vocals are golden, and just plain memorable to listen to. Now we're finally getting somewhere in what made The Beatles an amazing group to begin with! 4.5/5<br><br>7. P.S. I Love You- Average love song. Decent production and vocals. Beatles have written better. 3/5<br><br>8. Baby, It's You- Seems to me that the biggest issue for this album is that much of the songs are generic. This is no exception. Almost exactly the same song as P.S. I Love You just with cool overdubs from John Lennon. 3.5/5<br><br>9. Do You Want to Know a Secret- Gosh, I'm sick of these generic love songs!!! Give me ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman"" any day!!! 2/5<br><br>10. A Taste of Honey- This bluesy arrangement rocks, mainly on your typical Beatles harmonies! 4/5<br><br>11. There's a Place- Of the love songs on this album, this one feels the most poignant. So well-written and beautifully crafted. 4.5/5<br><br>12. Twist and Shout- John's vocals kill this track to the classic it has become! Rock and roll classic! So iconic! Probably the best track on the whole freakin album! 5/5<br><br><br>So as a whole, Introducing the Beatles is pretty much your average debut album from a group who eventually became master icons in the business. The middle of the album lags down the overall score due to some generic and average love songs that lack some of the group's later standards, but when The Beatles showcase their talents well, there's some great songs hidden in the mix.<br><br>I rate Introducing the Beatles an overall 3.5/5. <br><br>Standout tracks recommended: ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Chains"", ""Love Me Do"", ""A Taste of Honey"", ""There's a Place"", ""Twist and Shout""</span>,<span>This is an ok album for the Beatles' debut. Half of it is covers, so points deducted for that. It does have some awesome songs like ""I Saw Her Standing There"" or the classic ""Twist and Shout."" This is good and catchy beat music but since it is half covers I won't give it 3.5 stars.</span>,<span>I've tried before, out of sheer bloody-mindedness, to think of this as the best Beatles album– it's as widely dismissed as it is crude and (in places) punky enough to appeal to the seasoned iconoclast, the sort of iconoclast who knows that it's more iconoclastic to love a disliked Beatles album than to dislike the Beatles altogether. But I'm not really an iconoclast, not so much as I am a humble girl with humble opinions, and, for better or worse, my opinion is that this album, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout"" notwithstanding (and the title track and ""Love Me Do,"" to extents), really is as limp and unmemorable as you've heard that it is.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">""Well, she was just 17""</em><br><br>This is one of those records i would definitely consider good, but forgettable compared to the other records in a discography.

Their version of their own 'Do You Want to Know a Secret"" is till one of the loveliest love songs ever composed and recorded.<br><br>Great opening, great opening track, great album. Great!</span>,<span>As dire of an offense as it is, not only to admit this but to actually a hold a view of this kind, I think I've come to a realization about my relationship with The Beatles and how it differs from the poppy, Of Montreal-loving bunch that my multitude of local friends seem to be a part of. That epiphany is this: I like the Beatles, but I much more appreciate the overall influence they've given to rock music than I have for the band themselves. Sprawling ceiling posters of <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em> seem to have a vast effect on even the mildest rock fans, but these album artworks make me think of a few exciting songs and nothing more, save the baffling portraits of the Beatles where I cannot tell a single one of them apart (<em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em> excluded, as they finally broke the wizard's spell and stopped being clones by the 1970s). Of course, anybody who is anyone knows and can hold a verbatim singalong to a large array of Beatles hits, ""Love Me Do"" planting itself within me from first grade and me wondering of what sorts of grown-up songs lay in this spectacular group's coffers. Had I known of ""Octopus' Garden"" and ""Yellow Submarine"", maybe I'd have been sworn off of their greatness completely. I'm lucky that ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"" was the catalyst that brought me to today's personal knowledge of them; oh, what would I have done if <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> was my starting point?<br><br>There's actually a lot of joy that can be extracted from a record like <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. No expectations were even dreamt or crafted for this upcoming, dime-a-dozen merseybeat quadruplet, and while I'm sure it's their popularity that completely drove some of these songs to their renown, there aren't many classic moments like that first line of the opening song ""I Saw Her Standing There"": ""She was just seventeen / You know what I mean."" This record establishes itself as fun-loving pop from the moment one sets foot beyond the gate, and any crowds searching for ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" / ""Hey Jude"" / ""Happiness is a Warm Gun""-esque material will be sorely disappointed by this album's lack of poignancy. This isn't a thoughtless release, but it's not too profound either. I imagine that distinguishing this act from any of the others in the time period was downright impossible, and say, 'The Beatles' to a random passerby in 1963, you'd probably only get a few hip people who knew what you were talking about. With this being the only album to their name, it makes sense.<br><br>Still, there's plenty of hits: ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", ""P.S. I Love You"", and that glorious ""Twist and Shout"" cover that Ferris Bueller will always be remembered by. This is pretty low in my rankings of albums to kick back and enjoy when I'm in a contemporarily rare mood to hear The Beatles, but it's not a throwaway. It's downright charming to know that my generation's parents were kicking in the womb when a record like this came to be, and to grow up in an age that was crazed and ravished by what this CD's successors would go onto perfecting... this is a milestone of rock music whether you like it or not.</span>,<span>This is where my love of music begins, the beginning of the British Invasion. I'm not a huge Beatles fan, more like a casual fan. I prefer their later, more diverse and less poppy albums. Without them,though, my favorite bands probably wouldn't exist. This album is where Beatlemania began. <br><br>Based on just the music, it's an enjoyable pop album. Twist and Shout and I Saw Her Standing There are the 2 tracks that I like the most.

"<span>After reading a number of negative reviews on this particular Beatles record I've decided to make my own review… (sort of review). <br><br>I must have listened to this record now at least twenty-five to thirty times and still cannot fathom how some people would be so repulsed by it; as some of the scathing half-star and one star reviews would suggest. Due to the generic, soulless, commercialised bubble-gum pop of today churned out by the record companies to placate the musically challenged teenagers of today; the genre of 'Pop' has lost its credibility as a 'proper' genre. People often seem to enjoy repeating the same thing about the Beatles more relaxed and fun early records, ‘too me this is nothing more than a simple guitar pop record’. They say this in a derogatory manner as if to have us believe that this record has no credibility or musical integrity simply as a result of its being considered a ‘guitar pop’ or ‘pop rock’ record. This to me is absolutely absurd, to undermine a record simply for the adoption of a certain genre is ridiculous, merely because you do not understand a genre or particularly ‘enjoy’ it doesn’t mean it has no credibility. <br><br>This generally comes from hard-core Heavy Metal or Rap fans that deem any other music genre to be unworthy of their ears. This particularly annoys me as even I, not being someone who enjoys Heavy Metal, can appreciate the appeal and innovativeness of the likes of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath etc… and not devalue their music simply because I myself do not understand or enjoy it as a musical form. Taken as it is and in the larger context of (all) musical output (from 1950 to now) and compared to most records of today and even the fifties, this is a very solid pop record which is an immeasurably fun, exciting and feel-good record. Had this been released by any other band in the sixties it would be considered a solid effort and a fun record. whereas, due to its distinction as a Beatles record many take it upon themselves to compare it to their later works (i.e. Abbey Road, Revolver etc…) and believe as it is not as ‘innovative’ or ‘sophisticated’ as the later Beatles masterpieces it has no credibility in their catalogue. Well I personally think this is ridiculous and people are grossly underappreciating the raw fun and excitement of the record by taking it out of context.<br><br>Rant over… (Now for the review)<br><br>Soo, where was I… This was one of the first Beatles records and first (early) sixties records I ever listened too in full. I immediately fell in love with not just the record, but The Beatles and the sixties as a decade of truly great music and ground-breaking albums.<br><br>‘I Saw Her Standing There’ is a fantastic album opener and a brilliant track, it’s fun, loud and exciting and really opens you up to the rest of the record and instantly puts you in a good mood. Those whom deem this track to be ‘generic pop’ will likely say something along the lines of “it’s just another silly sixties pop song about girls and love, very dull, no substance or meaning’. So, let’s rant a little more (sorry about this)…. Music conveys an emotion in a way that it almost infects us and connects us to that particular piece of music and the emotion it emulates both lyrically and musically. Among many of the music listeners who I have heard dismiss this record have said “these are all boring love songs”. Now, love is an emotion, that in the musical world, is highly underrated and disregarded and many people believe that simply because a song, album or artist wants to express his feeling of love, you must assume that the track will be sub-par and dull because someone else (like Elvis) has already done a love song before (“lack of innovation, already been done before blah blah I’m so cool because my favourite songs are about anger and hate”). Love is an emotion every human has been touched by at some point and is just as potent as sadness, anger and grief (but any song about these emotions is apparently instantly much more interesting and has ‘deeper meaning’ than one about love… apparently… I’m looking at you Heavy Metal people). Apparently songs that inspire you to feel love and happiness and joy are so last six decades ago, ‘meaningless pop rubbish’. How dull must you be to not enjoy a song simply because it doesn’t have a deeper meaning that inspires some sort of melancholy.  Again this comes back to context. Taken in context this song and this album are supposed to be a fun, feel good, happy records meant to lift your spirits, and it does this very well. But according to some, because it’s a little too happy and doesn’t have any depressing stuff, It is flawed and pointless. It’s not supposed to be innovative, it’s not supposed to be listened to on whilst high to have some sort of out of body experience, and it’s not supposed to blow your socks off. This record is for fun, to inspire happiness and allow you to escape to some place simple and joyous just for that small moment; and it does its job very very well. I find it impossible to be sad when listening to this album despite whatever rubbish is happening in my life. But apparently it’s not as experimental as say Revolver so I guess it’s just early Beatles rubbish, oh well…<br><br>Ok, let’s make the rest of this review a bit quicker. I’ll review it briefly as whole as opposed to individual songs. No more outbursty rantishness and more like a ‘proper’ review.<br><br>Overall I’d give this album a solid 9.5/10 (Five Stars). It really is a classic early sixties feel-good pop album and I can certainly agree with the Rolling Stone magazine placing it at 39th on their list of greatest albums of all time (26th on my own personal list). Taken as it is, without comparing it to the later (outstanding) Beatles stuff, it is a very solid album and also a timeless one. It’s rare, I think, to find an album such as this which contains so much joy and happiness in one 33 minute sitting. I believe this is a damn fine record and deserving of its place in the Beatles canon (my 8th favourite of The Beatles discography) and not as ‘disposable’ as some people see it in the Beatles catalogue). If people advise you not to listen to this as an introduction to the Beatles, ignore them and judge for yourself, honestly it’s not as good as the likes of Pepper, Revolver, Rubber Soul etc.. but that does not mean for one minute it’s a ‘bad’ or ‘dull’ record. Don’t ever let others dictate what music is good and what isn’t. Music is subjective, and that is one of many reasons it truly is THE greatest art form.<br>And again, sorry for the ranting. hopefully I’m forgiven…</span>,<span>""Twist and Shout"" is the only good song on this album. Pretty much everything else is just bland music with awful lyrics.</span>,<span>Listen to it again. <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is the debut album by the Beatles and considering that they went on to make <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Pepper</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em> and shape rock and roll into art, it's easy for some to underrate and overlook this. Yeah, okay, fine, half of the songs are covers and coming from the greatest songwriting duo the genre ever produced, that seems a bit excessive and weird. And sure, ""Love Me Do"" lyrically sounds like written on the cuff fluff. But how many cover songs are as fantastic as their rendition of ""Twist and Shout""? And ""Love Me Do"", while primitive by their standards, is a killer hook. Recorded in a day, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> shows a fresh faced and brilliant band that would still be talked about even if this was the extent of their legacy. Few debuts have been quite this realized or this great.</span>,<span><strong class=""rymfmt"">Notes</strong><br><br>Simpletons write this off as simple, damning it with faint praise like “It’s good compared to the other stuff at the time” or “They’ll do better.” And indeed it was better than the other stuff at the time, and if you want to know by how much, check out the (fucking atrocious) debut album by the Beach Boys the previous year. And they will do better, sure, but it wouldn’t be for a while, and if you want to hear a much, much worse album, listen to the following <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em>; it’s a universal <em class=""rymfmt"">fact</em> that the Beatles’ “Twist and Shout” is the definitive version; it’s a lot harder to convince me that the Beatles’ version of “Roll Over Beethoven” is truly better than Chuck Berry’s when all they’ve done is play louder and clap along. Yeah, there are plenty of covers ... who the fuck cares, if they're done well (and in this case, done better)?<br><br>Sure, it’s not perfect. There wasn’t much reason for this to be 14 songs instead of just 12 (which was closer to the norm at the time anyway, but the Beatles wanted to be bigger than anyone else from the get-go): ditch “A Taste of Honey” and “P.S. I Love You” for a better listening experience (though I do like the way Paul McCartney stretches out “you” in the latter; “you-hoo-ooh!”). Meanwhile, the sexual implications in “She was just seventeen / If you know what I mean” (you can <em class=""rymfmt"">hear</em> Paul McCartney tossing us a wink right after) or inside John Lennon’s voice on “Twist and Shout” are entirely absent in “Chains”; ditto the emotion of “Baby It’s You”, where John Lennon finds out he's being cheated on (""cheat ... cheat ..."") but stays with her anyway (his second best vocal performance on the album, listen to how he breaks words apa-art) missing in “Misery.” <br><br>But fun fact: this isn’t that simple. “Misery” is a throwaway, you say? Nonsense – check out that really brief descending piano figure (at the 0:44 mark; you’ll know it when you hear it) that makes the shortest track on the album feel more special than a lot of the longer ones. The lyrics are too lovey-dovey and repetitious in “Love Me Do,” you say? Then focus on that harmonica. The bridge of “Do You Want to Know a Secret” too simple, you say? Then have at the counterpoint in the one on “Baby It’s You.” Meanwhile, Ringo Starr’s vocals on “Boys” are the best of his career (the people who claim Ringo Starr couldn’t sing or play drums are just <em class=""rymfmt"">looking</em> for ammo and not finding any, and if you truly, truly think the latter is true, listen to his thunderous drumrolls bringing everyone back to the main melody on “Twist and Shout”) (and drumming wise, he only gets better from here); ditto John Lennon’s vocals on “Twist and Shout”, obviously. And John Lennon and Paul McCartney’s close harmonies didn’t develop over the years, they came fully formed and ready to go. And hooks, obviously, hooks <em class=""rymfmt"">everywhere</em>, either in the main vocals or the backing ones (ie. the “BAP SHOO AH!” of “Boys” or the “Sha-la-la”’s of “Baby It’s You”).<br><br>A lot of people claim <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em>’s about when the Beatles made an album that was worth it to listen to cover-to-cover, claiming that <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> doesn’t really bring it outside “I Saw Her Standing There” (one of the best opening sequences of a song/album <em class=""rymfmt"">ever</em>, try though the ultra-chord opening of “A Hard Day’s Night” and the punkish opening “Taxman” might to beat it), “Please Please Me” (“‘Come on!’ <em class=""rymfmt"">Come on!</em>’”) and “Twist and Shout” – nonsense. My favorite song is actually none of those, it’s “Anna (Go to Him).” The guitar riff moves in and out, slower then faster, louder then softer, crashing in like waves. Meanwhile, George contributes these extra vocals to the chorus that genuinely sound like they’re crying (“Anna…”); faraway and removed from everything else; psychedelic rock years ahead of schedule, while Paul McCartney boosts up the chorus with his own bed. And the vocal melody’s a goodie, and the words hit harder than any other Beatles song, even if they were written by someone else.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">B+</strong></span>,<span>If someone tells you there's nothing here beyond the bookends, they're wrong. If someone tells you this is The Beatles' worst LP, they're definitely wrong. If someone tells you Ringo is an untalented schmuck, you're welcome to rub ""Twist and Shout"" all over their wrong-as-hell face--and I'm not just saying that because ""Boys""' homoeroticism tickles my (and Brian Epstein's?) fancy. Between his ass-shaking kick shimmies and a skull-cracking snare finale, Starr is just as pivotal to the closer's glory as Lennon's wail.<br><br>Perhaps that's why this sometimes gets short shrift, then: The middle twelve tracks are generally too heartwarming to count as chest-thumping Rock, and those focused on The Fabs as genre saviors are less inclined to be taken with the sweet-and-salty blend. Mere speculation, I know.<br><br>What's more certain, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is The Beatles at their most adorable, from ""Ask Me Why""'s woo-woo-wooing to, well, all of ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"", all tempered by a rare looseness that steers away from the cloying. It's not always successful (""P.S. I Love You"", ""A Taste of Honey""), but the failures are a reasonable price to pay, for the coming year would bring the smug knowingness that would dog them--for better and for worse--for the rest of their career. Until then, George is welcome to whisper in my ear a bit longer.</span>,<span>This rather sparse, yet energetic first offering from the fab four gives the listener an understanding of the groups influences, and a taste of what is to come.  While a must for every serious Beatle fan, I would not recommend it to the casual fan, or as the disc to discover the group.</span>,<span>На первую долгоиграющую пластинку Ливерпульской четверки (Пол Маккартни, Джон Леннон, Джордж Харрисон, Ринго Старр – для тех, кто не знает) вошли 14 песен, в том числе с двух первых синглов. Члены группы изображены на обложке стоящими на лестничной площадке и смотрящими на нас сверху вниз, при этом на лицах играют улыбки. Первоначально планировалось сделать запись живьем в ливерпульском клубе, но акустика там была не ахти. Тем не менее, для сохранения эффекта на фонограмме оставили ритмический отсчет в начале – «раз, два, три, четыре». Половину композиций составили каверы, самыми удачными из которых можно назвать медленную «Anna (Go to Him)» (песня Артура Александера, очень повлиявшего на ранний стиль Джона, который здесь поет очень страстно), размеренную «Baby It’s You» (из репертуара чернокожих девушек The Shirelles; «Ша-ла-ла» отличное), завораживающую «A Taste of Honey» (из одноименного кинофильма; есть в ней нечто мистическое) и хит всех времен и народов «Twist and Shout» (впервые исполненный The Isley Brothers, но получивший феноменальный успех именно благодаря «Битлам»), в котором Джон поет так, словно вот-вот порвет связки; хуже всего вышла «Chains» (из репертуара женской группы The Cookies). Запоминается еще вокальный дебют Ринго Старра в любимой им «Boys» (снова от The Shirelles). Однако песни непосредственно «Битлов» получились в основном интереснее: от МакКартни – энергичная «I Saw Her Standing There» (с соло Джорджа), ритмичная «Love Me Do» (простейший текст, но зато какая гармоника), романтическая «P.S. I Love You» (Пол спел ее дебютом с Джоном), – и от Леннона – милая «Ask Me Why», хитовая «Please Please Me» (задуманная как подражание Рою Орбисону), очаровательная «Do You Want to Know a Secret?» (впервые поет Джордж, отличная подпевка), полуфилософская «There’s a Place» (вдохновившая Алана Олдриджа на создание иллюстраций к песням The Beatles; он изобразил Леннона, спускающегося в самого себя). Результатом совместного творчества Пола и Джона стала неплохая «Misery», написанная для певицы Хелен Шапиро. На многих песнях присутствует гармоника, что явно добавляет им шарма. Альбом не так хорош, как «Вечер трудного дня», но все же для дебюта весьма силен, хотя некоторые в ту пору утверждали, что песни у группы стали похуже, чем на синглах. Как бы то ни было, альбом разошелся очень быстро, популярность «Битлов» продолжала нарастать, хотя это было всего лишь начало.<br><br>Рецензия написана 20 марта 2005 года</span>,<span>Jamás entenderé la exagerada sobrevaloracion a este debut taan malo y flojo... Jamás</span>"
"<span>Despite sounding late 50s / early 60s pop this is really an extremely important album in music history. By playing the musical game and scoring pop hits on the charts THE BEATLES found instant popularity in their native UK before conquering the rest of the world soon thereafter. This is the first step in their conquest of the music charts which allowed them the financial freedom to explore music to their hearts desire just a few years down the road which would jump start the entire musical world and allowing free-form creativity to blossom in myriad directions including progressive rock.<br><br>Despite being the debut this album has virtually zero indicators of what was to come as THE BEATLES themselves probably had zero clues of what they were to become. This album finds the band with a brand new drummer by the name of Ringo Starr fresh in the seat of the recently booted Pete Best while the famous John Lennon / Paul McCartney songwriting team was only beginning to get their engines greased and their mojo running with George Harrison in their shadow but still sneaking in a contribution or two.<br><br>This album is only half originals with the remaining being covers of various artists. This is a mixed bag. Songs I like include – “I Saw Her Standing There”, “Chains”, title track, “Love Me Do”, “P.S. I Love You”, “Do You Want To Know A Secret”, “Twist And Shout.” The rest I don't like. That means half this album is good and the rest I could live without. If the album was as good as the half I like I would rate this higher but because a few of these good songs are really great early 60s pop songs and this is THE BEATLES, it seems like 3 stars is a perfect fit for this debut album even though I can't imagine not having it as a part of my greater musical collection. Only good but still very essential for me.</span>,<span>This is one of those albums that just makes you think ""It's OK. I guess they had to start somewhere."" This is a good album, with plenty of the best early Beatles songs (""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Twist And Shout"") and a lot of boring covers and uninteresting, overly simple material. I have no idea how this is a better album than every Radiohead album and every Coltrane album, which is what Rolling Stone believes for some reason.</span>,<span>I don't understand the adulation of The Beatles; intellectually, it makes sense, as they were innovators. But their music does not connect to me emotionally, at all. They weren't especially good singers, their sound was never that interesting, their melodies never attracted me, and their lyrics were mostly asinine. It's not even a case of me not liking 1960s pop; I'm a big fan of The Kinks and The Beach Boys, and The Zombies were pretty cool as well. But when I hear The Beatles, I hear well-structured music that does not connect with me in any way, or evoke any feelings or images. Yet I've managed to hear every single one of their albums, because for so many years I heard people praising them endlessly (their not even cool to dislike for chrissakes) and I desperately searched for the thing that I was missing. I've never found it. <br><br>Of their records, Please Please Me might be the lowest of the low, give or take Let it Be. People mythologise the fact that this record was recorded in one day, but that's not a good thing as far as I'm concerned; it sounds rushed, sloppy and in general, the production is shit. The whole thing becomes deeply unpleasant to listen to after about ten minutes because the sound hurts my ears. The songs don't help in some cases either; Chains and Boys are pretty much complete rubbish. The best would be Misery or the title track I guess, but mostly listening to this record just makes me stare at the clock intently. With the Beatles is also not my thing, but it's a much better version of what the band were going for here.</span>,<span>The mistake that people sometimes make when it comes to the fab four is that they compare their early releases with what would come a few years later instead of with the other stuff that was around at the time. At a time when the charts were dominated by harmless matinee idols and pretty boy acts the Beatles put rock'n'roll back on the map and made it once again the dominant genre in popular music. There are of course the incredibly catchy tunes, but there's also their sheer enthusiasm and the fact that they made playing this music sound like the most enjoyable experience one could have that is responsible for that. This album is not as stunning in it's awesomeness as their early period peak album ""A Hard Days Night"" would be, but it's nevertheless pretty irresistible, and with tracks like McCartney's ""I Saw her Standing There"" and Lennon's incredible cover of The Isley Brothers' ""Twist and Shout"" it has it's moments of greatness.</span>,<span><a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CJ8gvRZOlE"" target=""_blank"">The Beatles - Please Please Me (Short Demo Album)</a><br><br>In my opinion this is just another 3 stars album, more closer to 3.5 than 2.5, although is the first ''The Beatles'' album, I don't see this band as something so extraordinary as the most people make believe, a good band, but this isn't the ''best all-time band''.<br>They helped to create much of today music, which is not to say that they were the most talented, or the only ones.<br>Many bands had the same or more talent and never reached the heights of fame.<br>But all this was excused if I personally liked the sound of the band, and the problem is that, although I like some individual songs as a whole falls short in my ear.<br>In this case, Please Please Me have 3/4 tracks that deserve 4/4.5 , these are, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout, Anna (Go To Him) and Ask Me Why.<br>The rest is ''dispensable''.</span>,<span>Las letras son de lo peor jaja pero bueno teniendo en cuenta el contexto histórico le regalo alguna estrella demás.</span>,<span>Darzę Beatlesów przeogromną sympatią, ale obcowanie z ich wczesnymi albumami to zwykle pewne wyzwanie, które wymaga wysłania mózgu na wakacje - debiut się z tego schematu nie wyłamuje. To nie jest zła muzyka, no ale poza wyjątkami to nieciekawy, infantylny, prosty i schematyczny rock and roll. Mimo wszystko rozbrzmiewa tu już gdzieniegdzie dusza tego zespołu, która rozwinie się w przyszłych latach, więc album bywa całkiem przyjemny, a tylko w nielicznych momentach trochę trudny do wytrzymania (<em class=""rymfmt"">P.S. I Love You</em>...). Ładna melodia tu, fajna żywiołowość tam i jakoś da się to przesłuchać bez większych narzekań. No i dość bezpretensjonalne to jest, Beatlesi nie udają tu, że grają coś więcej niż nieskomplikowany pop rock (niektórzy fani zespołu udają to za nich, ale to już inna sprawa). Szczególnie podobają mi się opener i closer. <em class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</em> nakręca chwytliwa melodia i przede wszystkim bardzo przyjemna linia basu. <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist and Shout</em> z zachrypniętym Lennonem ma z kolei naprawdę mocną energię, nie wspominając o chwytliwości.<br><br>Wiadomo, to są nagrania z lat 1962 i 1963, jesteśmy skrajnie daleko od jazzu, klasyki, tradycyjnego bluesa, więc nie ma co znęcać się nad chłopcami z Liverpoolu, ale też i nie ma co ich słuchać, zwłaszcza że nawet jeśli komuś podobają się w tej boysbandowej konwencji, to na paru późniejszych albumach wychodziła im ona dużo lepiej.<br><br><br>6.5 / 5.5 / 6.0 / 5.5 / 5.0 / 6.0 / 5.5 / 4.5 / 3.5 / 5.0 / 5.0 / 4.5 / 5.5 / 6.5<br><br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">5.5/10</strong></span>,<span>Please Please Me is often underrated and put aside as being an experimental album rather than a serious LP. While it may not be as well-written or deep as some of their later albums, The Beatles still pull off an amazing debut with some of their best songs.<br><br>I Saw Her Standing There is close to being the best on the album: it opens the LP with a catchy song that is still well composed and performed. It and Love Me Do are probably the best tracks, but Please Please Me and P.S. I Love You come close. Love Me Do isn't lyrically anywhere near the standard of later work, but John's vocals are a standout. Please Please Me is another superb performance, and P.S. I Love You is a standout of the early McCartney compositions. Misery, Ask Me Why, Do You Want to Know a Secret and There's a Place are good songs, but not standout Lennon-McCartney songs. The covers range from Ringo's first performance in Boys to John's screaming rendition of Twist and Shout, with a few in between. Boys is performed well, as are A Taste of Honey and Baby It's You. The only disappointing covers are Anna (Go to Him) and Chains, which are real 'filler' on the album and won't go down as classic Beatles performances. The album finishes with Twist and Shout, and they ended on a high note. The rock and roll anthem is a highlight, despite John having a cold on the day of recording nearly the whole album and only getting through one take of Twist and Shout before losing his voice. It still made the cut, and is one of the best tracks and definitely the best cover on the album.<br><br>Overall Please Please Me is a wonderful debut from a group that would go on to become arguably the most influential rock band in history. There are the poppy love songs like Love Me Do and P.S. I Love You, and the more rock songs such as Please Please Me and Twist and Shout. They all come together to make a brilliant LP, with only a couple of filler tracks and brilliant performances. The Beatles had definitely arrived.</span>"
"<span>This album has a fair amount of what I would call filler songs (don't most bands though?), but there are quite a few excellent songs here (especially considering the era) so I think this is one of the better early Beatles albums.</span>,<span>After the release of the Beatles second singles “Please Please Me”, which reached the number one spot in UK single charts, George Martin wanted his band to record an entire album quickly. The band played concert since 1960 and had enough songs for an entire album. Within one day they recorded about ten songs. Together with the two singles “Please Please Me”, “Love Me Do” and the B-Sides, the band had enough material for their first full-length album. <br><br>Half of the songs were covers and the other half were written by McCartney/Lennon.  <br>Back in 1963 The Beatles were a Rock N’ Roll/Merseybeat band who played short, catchy and happy tunes, which all sounded similar at least to me. <br>Even though I prefer the later record of the Fab Four I like some of the songs of the band’s debut.<br>My favorite tunes are the opening “I Saw her Standing There”, their first single ever “Love Me Do”, “There’s a Place” and the final “Twist and Shout”.<br>The rest of the album isn’t bad at all but the songs getting boring after listening to them more than five times.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is a classic, not because it's super good or anything but because it's the first Beatles album. This is where it all started. Not really, but that sounds neato. This album features some of the early Beatle masterpieces like fantastic opener <em class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist and Shout</em> and of course the legendary title track, the first of their numerous number one singles. It has fillers, but I wouldn't say that they're bad - although I have to say the band definitely worked the covers better on the latter of their early albums (that doesn't really make any sense at all...)<br><br>Anyway, it's a good album.</span>,<span>The Beatles' debut album may have been highly popular in his time, but in retrospect <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is one of the band's weakest releases, featuring cheesy, rather empty pop music. Making the very first steps of their career, the Beatles had yet to really develop their supreme musical abilites, and the album lacks in any true artistic taste, containing dull compositions and melodies and cheesy instrumental and vocal lines. Even the highlight songs from this album, like ""I Saw Her Standing There"" or the big hits ""Love Me Do"" and ""Please Please Me"", are made to laugh when compared to the true art the band would later create. All in all, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is absolutely not what represents the huge musical talent of the Beatles, who would already make a big jump forward with their next album.</span>,<span>Even their debut album carries with it a sort of uniqueness. Due to the swift recording section and similarity to their Cavern set-list, Please Please Me is essentially a pseudo-live album; a concept that was not often seen at the time. The four boys were troopers, sweating out eleven songs in three sections (nine hours total); it's all in a hard day's night I guess. I'm going to honor Lennon's word and not pay attention to the lyrics. This lets me focus on composition and not Paul's jail bait lyrics (I Saw Her Standing There.) Originally Martin wanted to record at The Cavern in front of an audience, fortunately that live session never happened. Martin was short on time so he booked The Beatles to record in Abbey Road, but he only had access to the studio for a day. On February 11 at 10:00 AM the first section started. <br><br>1 2 3 4 <br><br>Paul's scream would take a mind of its own as his career progressed but he seemed to have tamed it for I Saw Her Standing There. The riding bass line is ear-candy necessity for these kind of songs (thank you Chuck.) The ""woaaahhh"" bit makes this a repeat.<br><br>In hindsight the opening piano chords to Misery was a symbol of things to come. Martin would later expose them to the wonders of classical music. This country meets pop tune may very well be the first proto-emo song. No doubt there were a handful of teenage girls crying their eyes out remembering a lover or two; of course they could have been listening to Apache.<br><br>In terms of composition The Beatles enhanced Anna for the better by focusing on melody; unlike the original version which focuses on Arthur's voice. The tumbling crispy guitar riff, thanks to George Harrison, is enough to warrant a replay. <br><br>At the time of the recording Chains had been covered twice. Both version featured a unique take on its composition. The Everly brothers' version, arguably the best version, features the ingenious usage of the tambourine as shackles. The Cookies' version features your standard clap that are impossible to resist. The Beatles covered Cookies' version but had nothing new or unique to add. A shortcoming of their part but cut them some slack they only had a day. <br><br>Boys features the rather plain debut of Ringo in lead vocal. Other than the whole homosexual overtone, of which Paul ""don't give a shit"" about, this is nothing more than a filler. <br><br>The tropical sweetness that is Ask Me Why shows the group's talent in vocal harmony. It also features George Harrison's raw talent in guitar, playing jazz chords reminiscent of the emerging Bossa Nova movement. <br><br>The titular song is the first of many number one singles for the band. This particular number one was a hit for its predictability, pop accessibility, and that thing I promised Lennon I wouldn't talk about. Lennon's use of the harmonica to transverse through verses is worth noting. <br><br>Love Me Do features a cute harmony riff and Ringo on the tambourine. I say cute because by the time 1963 rolled around a child phenom was beasting on the harmonica rendering any other harmonica recording sound inferior; also, Ringo was a studio noob so he didn't get to play the drums. HA.<br><br>Once again Ringo is kicked out of his post and replaced by session drummer Andy White. It is thick in melody and wonderful to listen to if you are in love. Then again, so would every song from that time. This time Ringo got to play the maracas. <br><br>I'm not even going to compare the original to the cover. It isn't fair to do so after you hear the former's vocal and melodic mastery. That being said, the cover in and of itself is plain, saved only by the way they handled the solo. <br><br>A Taste of Honey fails to cover the original version's haunting melody. The spacial mystical feel that the original created is nowhere to be found in this cover. Kudos to Martin for increasing the reverberation to create the illusion of depth. <br><br>There's a Place. Filler. Move on.<br><br>The Beatles' cover of Twist and Shout is one of the few times nature intervenes to make a record better than the original. The raw raspy voice Lennon had due to his cold enhances the energy and intensity of the song. This is the version Bert Russell wanted. <br><br>The album featured all the little things that made The Beatles legendary. Their ability to make a song better by enhancing its features can be noticed in Anna. Martin's classical background is noticed in Misery. Their interest in foreign music is noticed in the jazz chords in Ask Me Why. Their raw energy is noticed in Twist and Shout. These aspects were mastered as The Beatles' career evolved. Of course I can say this in hindsight because their career ended; but back then they were only a pop group dreaming of making it big.</span>,<span>An excellent debut from a band that would show its quality over the years. Please Please Me was a simple album of great, catchy rock and roll songs that raised the bar for albums and original writing.</span>,<span>I've got a balanced feeling about this album. Some are really bad (PS I love you), some are really boring (Anna or Ask me why), but there are some really good stuff that can make us imagine that it's really the Beatles. <br><br>The next one is indefinitely better</span>,<span>The Beatles come in with their first record. There are no tracks which are bland, but compared to their later stuff, it can be seen by some as dull. However, the album really shines if you wanna hear the four when they first started out!</span>"
"<span>It is a bit ironic that one of the most creative and successful musical groups started so plain and moderate. Meshing well with the sixties pop scene, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is more a reflection of the time period rather than a groundbreaking album. Although the Lennon/McCartney songwriting powerhouse is operational, it is still in its infancy as the duo sticks to fairly conservative pop numbers, relying on vocal melodies for foundation. That being said, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> does deliver what is advertised: fourteen pop numbers, a few covers, and a handful of catchy cuts that would establish their hold in the music business. <br><br>Following popular pop format, all instruments are supportive with the emphasis almost entirely on the vocals which are delivered mostly by budding vocalists McCartney and Lennon. The best tracks on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> are the most well known: ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Please Please Me,"" ""Love Me Do,"" and ""Twist and Shout."" The rest of the included tracks are largely disposable with perhaps the out of place inclusion of ""Boys"" leading the way. McCarney and Lennon's vocal work is good, but a bit raw throughout <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. Both will further develop with future albums. <br><br>My thoughts on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> are similar to most Beatles albums: the best tracks lie somewhere in the good to sublime scale of accolades (good in the case of this album), but there are at least an equal number of tracks that add weight to the other side of the fulcrum. Perhaps a stronger album in the early sixties than it is today, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is certainly worthy of some of the praise that it receives, but is far from their best work or other works from that time period. Of course witnessing the fascinating metamorphosis of the Beatles over the course of their musical tenure is required to fully appreciate their legacy - and that metamorphosis begins with <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>.<br><br>High Points: ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Please Please Me""</span>,<span>Rating by Song Average: 3.35<br><br>Rating By Album 3.5<br><br>Favourite 3 Songs: I Saw Her Standing There, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout<br><br>Least Favourite 2: Anna, A Taste Of Honey <br><br>I'm glad that it was this album that was this groups debut and not say With or For Sale. That would have made for a rough opening indeed. <br><br>Please Please Me is an album of The Beatles as we know them at their bumpkiniest. They have their moments of horrid simplicity, facepalm worthy lyricism and generic chording. However we forgive them because of their relative inexperience and heck, it was the 60's!<br><br>There's a fire, enthusiasm and energy that's present in the Fab Four on this album that translates very clearly on the tracks like I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me and Twist and Shout. This is one of those cases where the highlights of the album are in fact what got popular over time.</span>,<span>Great pop album.  Pop songs that grow on you instead of get annoying.</span>,<span>Ça commence par un gros « one, two, three, f*ck ! ». J’avoue que je ne m’attendais pas à ça !<br>Non, sérieux…<br> <br>J’ai décidé de me faire la discographie des Beatles. Je ne connais qu’une vingtaine de gros tubes, comme un peu tout le monde en fait, et je suppose que je passe à côté de quelque chose d’énorme. Et effectivement, dès ce premier album, dont je ne connaissais que « Love me do » que je trouve assez bof, ainsi que « Twist and Shout » assez fun et énergique (ça devait être du Trash Metal à l’époque), je suis déjà conquis : « I saw her standing », excellent titre d’intro, les belles semi-ballades « Misery » et « Anna »,… J’ai déjà découvert quelques petites pépites.<br><br>Question parole, il ne faut pas être trop exigent. Entre les « Love, I love you, love of the love of my love » et les «love the love and ps I love you, my love…», on a vu plus inspire quand même. En plus, j’ai fait mes recherches sur Wiki : je pensais que la Beatlemania avait commencé avec des titres genre “Yesterday” ou “Eleanor Rigby” mais non !! C’est avec cet album qu’ils ont mis le feu aux poudres ! Ok, il est sympa, mais pas de quoi se jeter partout.<br><br>Me voilà parti pour un marathon Beatles ! Et vu comme ça commence, je suis assez content et pressé d’arriver aux fameux grands albums.</span>,<span>Although it is a Beatles album, Please Please Me sadly isn't among their finest work, although the title track and I Saw Her Standing There showcased their future songwriting talents and they performed outstanding covers of Twist and Shout and the underrated Baby It's You. Overall, a fair but not quite excellent album.<br><br>Final Score: 53/100</span>,<span>The Beatles - Please Please Me <br><br>7.5<br><br>I can never understand people who think The Beatles were a halfway decent boy band before 1965. Sure, I wouldn't rate their debut higher then their later albums, but I probably listen to it just as much.  It is so youthful, immediate, energetic and charming and anyone that tells me this band wasn't talented apart from the hype that was later thrown at them need their ears checked out and their dancing shoes cleaned. Maybe their debut would have gone unnoticed if they didnt turn into the biggest band in history, but many great albums go unnoticed and this surely would have been one of them.  Mccartney's ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is one of their best early tracks, the title track has a seductive chorus and a great little harmonica part, ""Love Me Do"" will always have a soft spot in my heart being one of my first Beatles songs and ""Twist and Shout"" gives me chills every darn time I hear it.  The more I think about it, the more the  ""what would have been"" question seems superfluous... there is no alternate reality where this band would have gone unnoticed. The charisma and charm is simply too addictive.</span>,<span>I'm not sure if it's possible to call any Beatles album ""underappreciated"" without being laughed at. Even now, more than fifty years since their heyday, it's hard to go more than two steps on just about any music website before you run into either some obsessive rattling on about how great The Beatles were or some fool contrarian loudly yelling about how overrated they are. The band is ubiquitous and nigh-universally worshiped by the music intelligentsia. But <em class=""rymfmt"">if</em> there is an underappreciated Beatles release, it's this one. It's The Beatles' best pre-psychedelic album (yes, better than <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album207]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/help-2/"" class=""album"">Help!</a></em>), and it's about as perfect a slice of <a title=""[Artist1608]"" href=""/artist/buddy-holly"" class=""artist"">Buddy Holly</a>-worshipping merseybeat as exists--the second half especially (from the title track onward).</span>,<span>When I was teenager my cousin bought the box set of vinyl albums. So I did what teens did back then. I borrowed the set and taped the lot.<br><br>The formula for the first few Beatles albums was a 14 track selection of originals and covers. The debut has eight originals and I think they shine over the covers, maybe with the exception of 'Twist and Shout'. The rest of the covers sound a bit old and dated, not fresh and new like the originals. Well...as far as fresh and new sounded 50 years ago !<br><br>Fanatacism aside, several of these songs went on to become standards. Everyone knows them, it's hard not to like them. I like them. I'm talking about 'Love Me Do', 'Please Please Me' and 'I Saw Her Standing There'. <br><br>Better was to come but this shows the Fab Four knew what they were doing from the outset. Worth a listen if you've never heard the full album.</span>"
"<span>A menudo menospreciado dentro de la discografía del cuarteto, pero tan revolucionario, como el Revolver o el Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Please Please Me, son catorce canciones que suenan de la mejor manera posible, aun dejando en estos tiempos, fuertes impresiones. El mejor debut de todos los grupos de la invasión británica.</span>,<span>I love the covers here. Their original material is very nice too.</span>,<span>The record where it all started, the career of the greatest pop/rock band of all time. Please Please Me is probably The Beatles most traditional Rock n Roll record. The album has several cover songs and even on some of the bands original tracks you can hear a strong influence from the American Rock n Roll sound of the late 50's and early 60's. A great place to start if your starting out on your Beatles journey, gives you a good picture of where the band started and shows just how amazing they were that within 5 years of recording this record they would be producing some of the most ground breaking music ever heard. Taking what was to come aside, this is a great record in its own right full of tunes that are sharp and fresh, pretty instant and full of pop sensibility.</span>,<span><strong class=""rymfmt"">Summary:</strong><br>The Beatles' first album is average, unfortunately. It's clear that the potential was here - as evidenced by songs such as ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist and Shout"". But, sadly, this potential doesn't amount to enough on this album. It starts off particularly well with the aforementioned ""I Saw Her Standing There"" then has around four or five weak songs that possess few interesting or memorable qualities. It's a far cry from some of the later masterpieces that the band produced, despite some brief glimpses of the talent we saw.<br><br>Side B actually starts very well, with two songs revolving around a similar theme - love - that manage to capture what the early Beatles were about - an entertaining pop group that won girls' hearts and garnered positive media reviews. The other songs on the B-side are little more than average compositions, but the album's closer - ""Twist and Shout"" - is one of the band's best songs, and it does bring the album up slightly, though it's not enough to make up for the poor middles of each side of the album. <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Highlights: </strong> I Saw Her Standing There; Love Me Do; P.S. I Love You; Twist and Shout<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Verdict:</strong> A mediocre debut that, aside from some promising glimpses, doesn't really deliver. <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Rating:</strong> 6/10.</span>,<span>Tweeëndertig minuten die de popwereld voorgoed veranderden. Dat is eigenlijk nog de beste omschrijving van dit debuutalbum van The Beatles. Het titelnummer werd een onverwachte nummer 1-hit en dus moest er snel een album in elkaar gestoken worden. De groep had al enkele covers klaar om op te nemen. De andere helft van het album zijn eigen nummers. Die covers zijn zeer goed gekozen en duiden op een groep met een zeer brede muzieksmaak. Het sterke is dat ze al die invloeden samenbrengen in één geluid: het geluid van The Beatles. Rock’n roll, R&amp;B, blues en soul zijn de voornaamste ingrediënten, maar uiteindelijk zijn het de spannende harmonieën die van dit album een nog steeds opwindend en fris popevenement maken. Later zouden ze uiteraard nog veel straffer uit de hoek komen. Maar op dit debuut was al duidelijk dat de wereld zich moest klaarmaken voor een nieuw geluid.</span>,<span>Overall- 3.54= B<br><br>This is an album with 14 pleasant songs. Unfortunately none of these songs really hit hard in a way that the Beatles did many times throughout their career. A must have for any fan, but still not one of their best.</span>,<span>Quite rough sound and production compared to some later material, also the vocal harmonies (and vocals in general) are not as polished as later in their carreer. Yet this album contains so many Beatles classics it's actually insane, especially considering most of the tracks are self-written (although there are a few covers there too). <br><br>Already here the band catches you with the catchyness and melodies. Rather tight playing as well, so all elements that brought them to the top o' the world are to be seen already here.</span>,<span>There has been a lot of interest in ""Please Please Me"" because its 50 since it was recorded and various artists have been recreating it on the Radio &amp; TV. So appropriate to listen to it again. Now I have got the original mono CD which I bought in a junk shop ( its not in great nick) so I got this stereo version released in 2009 and promptly forgot I had it. And that leads to an admission - I always thought that this - The Beatles' début was not very good and that its was only by the time of ""Hard Day's Night"" that The Beatles got any good. 50 years ago as a eight year old, I preferred The Stones - and I still do except.... well except listening to ""Please Please Me"" today, its great - 8 tracks written by Lennon &amp; McCartney and interesting covers and although the stereo is crude - this CD sounds great.  There is not a weak track and every one of its 14 tracks and 32 minutes is great. 50 years later - a real surprise!</span>"
"<span>Time to review the Beatles.<br><br>Album #1 doesn't approach the history-making heights that many of their later releases would.    It's got a similar fun and light-hearted pop feel that their other early albums would have, but it's a lot more uneven, wobbly, dated-sounding, and at times cheesy.    <br><br>There's still some absolutely classic material here though.  I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me and Love Me Do are fantastic showcases of the band's songwriting skills and vocal harmonies.    Do You Want to Know a Secret is an innocent and sweet love song - bit cheesy, but full of warmth.    Twist and Shout features a vocal performance like none other, which to this day still sounds completely insane and is overflowing with manic, exuberant energy.   Other tracks are more forgettable but the highlights are worth hearing, and the whole album is an interesting look at where the Beatles began.</span>,<span>The debut album.   ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Love Me Do"", and ""Twist and Shout"" are here, but the filler is pretty damned good too.</span>,<span>good album, <br><br><br>pretty sure i would've like it more had i put a little more effort into actually listening to it.<br><br>doesn't do particularly well as background music.<br><br>have to hear this out again.</span>,<span>Hello there. Let me introduce myself. I am the guy who likes early Beatles as much as late Beatles. Pleased, pleased to meet you. Ha-ha!<br><br>Okay seriously, I am also the guy who really, really unabashedly loves early 1960's pop, and I might be the only one here. I mean, who, these days, really lauds albums by the Four Seasons, Dion, Gene Pitney, or the Crystals (four of my favorite artists)? Really the only reason anyone here on RYM gives a damn about early '60's pop is because of Phil Spector's studio innovations. Other than that? Zilch. Even the Beatles--the most feted popular musical act of all time--are ignored until late '64/'65ish. And why? Yeah, sure the early British beat groups were basically re-runs of everything happening in American rock/pop up-to-date--R&amp;B, a little blues, early rock 'n' roll, and Brill Building-esque pop. That's what they all were doing, from the Stones and the Beatles, to the Hollies, the Searchers, and Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers. It really wasn't all that new. But still, all one needs to do to appreciate the British Invasion is take a look into <em class=""rymfmt"">Billboard</em>'s records. ""Love Me Do"" hit no. 1 in February of 1964, knocking off Bobby Vinton's ""There! I've Said It Again."" Now, I know I said I love early '60's pop, but, seriously, has there ever been a more boring hit song in the history of humanity than ""There! I've Said It Again""? Man, rock 'n' roll might not have quite been dead in the States when Britain invaded, but damn, it sure was on the decline.<br><br>So then the Fab Four came, and we all--in a broad sense--know what happened the next six years as popular music changed beyond recognition never to be the same. Now, nobody could have foreseen this with the release of this mediocre beat album, could they? Well, they'd have to be pretty damn good--almost clairvoyant--to see that Beatlemania would someday transform into one of the most magnificent <em class=""rymfmt"">creative</em> forces ever. At the time of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, the Beatles were Hanson, or NSync, or Justin Bieber, or One Direction--they were a fad; eye candy for one generation of teenyboppers, soon to be replaced by whichever sensation came strutting about next. Then this Zimmerman guy discovered electricity, and rock 'n' roll was truly reborn... but that's a different story.<br><br>Let's go back to February, 1964, when everyone is saying that the Beatles are nothing more than a fad. Let's listen to their first release, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. By now, it's almost a year old, having been released in Britain in March of '63; by now, America's airwaves are under fire from all directions by British beat groups, one after another, and they all sound pretty much the same. Same influences, same arrangements, same fashion, same covers. (I mean seriously, how many British groups covered ""A Taste of Honey""? Way too many.) But, there's something unique about these moptops they call the Fab Four. Yes, they led the charge across the pond, but all in all, the American teen girls don't scream any louder for the Beatles than they do for Freddie &amp; the Dreamers at this point. It's early 1964, and if it's British, it sells with America's youth. So what is it? Why are they different? It's simple really: they are writing their own songs, and their <strong class=""rymfmt"">own</strong> material comprises the majority of their <em class=""rymfmt""><strong class=""rymfmt"">debut</strong></em> album. Do you realize how huge that is for a beat group at this time? Sure, their tunes are all cut-and-dried carbon copies of the Brill Building and early rock 'n' roll (a la Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard) styles whence they draw their influence, but this fledgling duo of songwriters (Lennon/McCartney) has laid the foundation for their own growths. (As we know now in retrospect) These guys cranking out songs like ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Please Please Me"" in 1964 are going to be writing masterworks like ""Hey Jude"" and ""A Day in the Life"" in just a few years' time. Look, you see those blokes on the Sullivan show? You think they're big now? Just wait. These boys are going to be huge. Mark my words.</span>,<span>En eksplosion af det pureste tidlig-Beatles-pop af den ekstremt lethjertede og ubekymrede (læs: overfladiske) slags, men ikke des jo mindre en fremragende debut - engagerende, varierede, amerikansk-inspirerede-men-samtidig-helt-sine-egne numre, hvoraf en lille håndfuld fortsat er allemandseje i hele verden, og med den i dag nærmest trademark'ede tostemmige vokal.</span>,<span>So, nun habe ich mich also durch das Rock'n'Roll-Niemandsland der frühen 1960er gekämpft und jetzt kommt auf einmal diese Platte raus, mit all dem jugendlichen, durch Reeperbahn-Auftritte gestählten Elan der jungen Beatles. Überaus poppiger, schwungvoller Rock mit großartigem, von Herzen kommendem Gesang -- durch den auch schwächere Nummern wie ""Chains"" noch hörbar bleiben, und durch den ""Twist and Shout"" zum absoluten Klassiker wird. <br><br>Das Album besteht zur Hälfte noch aus Coverversionen, und auch wenn die Eigenkompositionen noch sehr simpel gestrickt sind: Songs wie ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", oder meinen persönlichen Liebling ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" machen mir beim tausendsten Hören immer noch genauso Spaß wie beim ersten Mal: Perfekter Pop!<br><br>Man hört dem Album auch die Eile an, mit der es produziert wurde -- ein Großteil der Aufnahmen wurden an einem einzigen Tag eingespielt. Das tut ihm aber nur gut, denn dadurch hat es eine sympathisch unperfekte, leicht amateurhafte Note, durch die es bis heute frisch und fruchtig klingt. Mir zumindest gefällt es wesentlich besser als die folgenden, professionelleren und langweiligeren Alben.</span>,<span>I saw her standing there-To be honest this might be the song Ive heard in the real world by the Beatles surprisingly. Ive heard it 7 times in the last 5 days which is excessive by my standerds but still it sounds great. They came out of the gates firing on this one. It is a Lennon rocker<br>and he just let out all of his screaming. The lyrics were simple the chords very simple. Sounds like it could have been made live. Was big hit in America not sure if it was released in England  9.5/10<br><br>Misery-This one is sung by John and Paul sounds like a remake of a R&amp;B song, the harmonies are intoxicating and as the most of there songs at the time, the music<br>is absolutely catchy and sounds like any one could listen to it. Songs like this though filler tracks have a timeless quality, love the doo wop at the end as well.  9/10<br><br>Anna(Go to Him) This one was sung by Arthur Alexander who was suposedly a soul singer. This one hits that nerve to me, the song mixes blues and rock something they were doing left and right in 1963. The song also does <br>have a soul vibe to it. This song is sung by Lennon is a ballad kind of but it is the kind of song that maybe would have sounded better with Paul. Still the structure, layering and music is there already. One of the sharpest sounding albums of the 60's  8/10<br><br>Chains-This is another cover track it features George on lead vocals. I have had the pleasure of hearing the Cookies original and this is not it. George was still far away to the sound he needed to go for.<br>He is much better as usual on electric guitar. He to me sounds like what the Monkees sounded like and he made staggering strides on his vocal performances. here he was just trying to sound like John and Paul.  Still it does do somethings very well  7/10<br>At the end I heard great country esque ode to the Everly Brothers I liked that.<br><br>Boys-This one was a B side single to the imortal Shirelles will you still love me tomorrow. This song is surprisingly sung by Ringo and he already found his voice, just odd it was on this track which seems to be about girls wanting boys. The Beatles<br>decided to take it to a different place as they added soul, blues, R&amp;B and rock n roll. At this point in time they were trying to sound like Elvis Presley the black rockers are the rockabilly artist like Johnny Burnette  8/10<br><br>Ask Me Why-This one starts with woo woo woo's and features great harmonies, this is kind of in the doo wop style but with a mersey beat to sound over it. This is a cute little track so to say it sounds cuddly like a walk in the park hand in hand with your snookems. <br>For an original it was not one of the Beatles strong moments to say the least. What I like is the harmonies and the doo wop approach to it. 7/10<br><br>Please Please Me-The song that made the Beatles famous in there native England and one of the theme songs of 1960's beat, rock n roll, and pop music. This one is as contagious at the flu, it will make people of any age want to sing along or dance<br>they were famous at writing this catchy type of sound and basically this was one of the instances of that. Sublime harmonies, increddible use of the harmonica which they used alot in the wake of this songs sucess  10/10<br><br>Love Me Do-in case people were not dancing to the previous song they would of been by now. Side two starts where side one ends. The result is music that is increddibly catchy, has harmonica's, splending melodies<br>sharp live sounding productions with a Rhythym and Blues sound going on. Very coffee house sounding to me. There first single in UK, and a number one in the US. <br><br>P.S. I love you-There was alot of teen idol pop going around England and the US at this time period, the Beatles hated that kind of music but here they make a case that they would fit that category as well. Though <br>this one has a sound very similar to that of Roy Orbison, I can also here Ricky Nelson and the Everly Brothers. The production sounds like something the Beach Boys were doing in the US  8/10<br><br>Baby it's you-This one was done by the Chirelles though I think I remembered a late 60's Smith doing it. This one is Lennon, it has those sha la la chatty vocals that the Beatles were famous for and unfortunately got rid of. It has a raw<br>live quality to it, and I like the adlibs alot. This one is more of an ode to brill building and has a crisp production though there singles were sharper.  7/10<br><br>Do You Want to Know a secret-This was about the 6th big hit off the album. This song was maybe there most creative lyrically in the 1963-64 period. Even if the vocals were simplistic, there was a story and the Beatles were asking the listener to listen a little<br>deeper. The story was that John was pregnant with Julian with his wife Cynthia. This one was probally more for the ladies typical McCartney heavy on melodies and hooks. Great song craft 8.5/10<br>Oh it was Harrison, wow shows what I know maybe he did have it in him to sing something with pizzazz, he sounded identical to Paul.<br><br>A Taste of Honey-This one has a folk vibe to it, well a celtic folk vibe to it. I think it was a british standerd it mixes some blues and sad somber stuff. This one sounds extremely Irish to me<br>at least lyrically sounds like an Irish drinking song to me. This is a similar track to alot of the stuff by McCartney on most of there albums, great guitar  7.5/10<br><br>There's a Place-This is an original and John and Paul sing lead on it. This one sounds like a girl group song, is a ballad. The song also uses that harmonica again and the guitar has a blues motif to it.<br>The first album really has that blues, R&amp;B sound like so many of there icons as well as rock n roll. Drums sharp as usual, vocals superior, guitars and bass strong as always  8.5/10<br><br>Twist and Shout-This is how the album ends with the lead vocal not surprisingly from John. This is pretty much his rocker the one he will always be remembered for and it just might have one of the best vocal performances in the<br>history of rock and pop music, despite the fact that he was loosing his voice and was sick as a dog on it, something which can be heard. I will always remember this song from the dance sequence in Ferris Bueller<br>and it made the song a hit again. This is one of the better early Beatles tracks  9/10<br><br>Well this album to me is there second best pre Revolver work, it has a ton of vibes that there roots were founded in. The album has alot of blues based rock, it has some skiffle/folk in taste of honey, the Liverpool Merseybeat sound, they also <br>borrow from Doo Wop and most noteably Brill Building and Rock N Roll. Even on the first album these were 4 very diverse musicians who were only getting started. In the opening days the Beatles were playing around more in more with there sound in the Studio. Though<br>maybe they would never be this technically flawless ever again, the vocals are spectacular, the melodies, hooks are many times perfect, the instruments very good though they would improve on that.

I saw her standing there</span>,<span>The beginning of the most successful and most exciting career in modern music history.<br>From the very start of their plain recording experience, they showed their rich talent for songwriting (8 songs out of 14 are Lennon-McCartney originals) and producing catchy pop melodies. Build around the hit singles 'Please Please Me' (their first no. 1 in the UK on almost all chart publications) and 'Love Me Do' (# 17 in the fall of 1962), the first lp contains well known r &amp; b covers among others, from the Shirelles ('Boys', with lead vocals by Ringo Starr, 'Baby It's You') and The Isley Brothers '(Twist and Shout') and self-penned material with a love theme context and an merseybeat rhythm ('I Saw Her Standing There', 'P.S. I Love You', 'Do You Want to Know a Secret').</span>"
"<span>The Beatles' first album, recorded all in one day (except the four songs from earlier singles) shows them at their most emphatic and enthusiastic. It still sounds fresh and catchy today, and charmingly rough. It surely has not much to do with their polished later work, but it clearly shows three things: <br><br>First, the Beatles rocked like nobody's business. The upbeat songs here still kick dancefloor ass after 50 years -- the classic ""I Saw Her Standing There"", the wonderful Shirelles cover ""Boys"" (definitively surf sound here), and of course their immortal ""Twist and Shout"", which is clearly proto-punk in my opinion; and I can still remember being amazed as a twelve-year old when listening to my father's single!<br><br>Second, they could already write great pop songs. ""Please Please Me"", even if I heard it at least a thousand times, still is irresistible; but there are less well-known pearls on here, like Lennon's wonderful ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" (probably my fave on here), or the beautiful ""P.S. I Love You"" which is relatively complex already.<br><br>And finally: BOY, could they sing! This is what saves the lesser number likes ""Chains"" or ""Taste of Honey"" from being uninteresting and generic -- Lennon and McCartney always put everything they had into their voice. In ""Twist and Shout"", recorded at the end of the nine-hour session, it's plain to hear that Lennon's voice was close to breaking... all the better for the rawness of this song!<br><br>After listening to this, it's easy to understand the impact the Beatles made in the softened-up and sanitized world of rock'n'roll. 4 stars may be a rating that is a little too high, if you're looking for sophistication, complexity and/or some kind of deeper message. Then again, it may be a little too low: There are few records that still sound that fresh after nearly 50 years.</span>,<span>One of the greatest albums of all time!</span>,<span>Solid first album from the boys. Certainly not their best; however, still better than a lot of garbage released today. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is awesome and easily my favorite track.</span>,<span>The Beatles first album. Some good originals (I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, P.S. I Love You), some good covers (Twist and Shout, Anna), and some not so good songs. Energetic performances throughout but it's clear that their best albums are still to come.</span>,<span>Mais interessante o começo da banda do que as radiofônicas de todo dia.<br>Deste disco só duas são mais tocadas sempre: Love Me Do e Twist and Shout, mas a compilação vale a pena, no primeiro disco da banda.<br>As composições simples e de boas melodias é que fazem ser interessante, tem uma pegada mais rock, alma de início e inocência. Nada muito pensado.<br>Vale o grito.</span>,<span>This is one of the most revolutionary <strong class=""rymfmt"">Rock</strong> debut albums. Basically here, <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> made <strong class=""rymfmt"">Rock &amp; Roll</strong> and <strong class=""rymfmt"">Surf Rock</strong> a sound of the past, and from this point on <strong class=""rymfmt"">Rock</strong> music will become more <strong class=""rymfmt"">Pop</strong> chorus oriented for several years. That doesn't mean that the music on this album is very good, since <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> were still not great songwriters, but traces of their future excellence was already audible.  <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Overall: 2.73</strong></span>,<span>Grade: A<br><br>The fact that this whole album was recorded in a single day is mind blowing. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" starts things off with a bang, with it's propulsive melody. ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do"" are just enchanting and both are responsible for the start of Beatlemania. Other originals such as, ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"", are a bit on the tame side, but are still material other band's would have killed for. The sensational cover of ""Twist &amp; Shout"", outdoes the Isley Brothers version by miles and features earth shaking vocals from Lennon. The rest of the covers can bog the album down a bit, but it's a minor complaint for a debut album that proved just how much potential this group really had.<br><br>Choice Cuts: I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout</span>,<span>Rating The Beatles in relation to other bands is pretty pointless to me. They were the standard bearers and in my mind it's almost futile to compare the merits of other music to the fabs almost peerless catalog. For that reason I am rating their catalog against themselves. I'm not going to write reviews for the albums because pretty much everything that needs to be said has been said by folks much more eloquent and persuasive than me. <br><br>It's becoming rather trendy to deny The Beatles their accomplishments, to bash them and to downplay (or outright deny) their innovativeness. I can not seriously consider their thoughts-opinions because it's just complete denial of the historical (musical) record. They were a law unto themselves and should be judged accordingly. This was their official start and all of the trademarks are already apparent. Those would be honed to perfection in the next 8 years but here is where it began. In relation to the albums that followed this will never be considered one of their best but comparing it to other albums released in 1963 it's at the top of the heap. Engaging, vibrant, full of energy and a complete, solid all the way through, listening experience. Something that albums in 1963 were most definitely not. They were already breaking the mold.</span>"
"<span>The sound of the early Beatles doesn't quite entice me. Sure, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is not only one of their best album openers, but also one of their best songs, but the album is a mixed bag of average cover versions and only a couple of songs that are really worth their money (most notably ""Please Please Me"" and ""Twist and Shout""). <br><br>While at the time it was groundbreaking, these days and in retrospect this feels a bit like a collection of 1950s songs performed by young musicians who have not quite realized yet that a significant transformation of popular music to a more modern idiom was about to take place, and even less so that they would be an integral part of it. The revolution would start one album and two singles later.</span>,<span>There is so much energy on this album you help but carried away with it.  A great debut.  'Please Please Me' is probably still ther greatest two minutes of pop ever!</span>,<span>Simpler is better, this seems to be the motto of ""Please Please Me"" and I love it. Their songs and covers are absolutely charming and give you such a great vibe, they really take your cares away. If only life was that dreamy and simple! Really really good debut.<br><br>Favourite songs: ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is brilliant, ""Love Me Do"" - that harmonica is to die for, ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"", one of their sweetest songs, and who doesn't love ""Twist and Shout"" (?)!<br><br>Least favourite: ""Chains"" and their cover of ""Baby It's You"" (Yes, Ronettes did it better)</span>,<span>Brilliant debut. The production is great with simple pop songs that are consistent and short and don't meander.<br>I actually prefer this stage of The Beatles to later albums as I can't tolerate their dependency on doing joke songs or tackling genres of music they're not good at.</span>,<span>Though there is no doubt that in the early 1960s this album was a huge deal, I wasn't around then, so I can only judge it as a modern listener with a universe of rock music to choose from. To my mind, it's a perfectly decent rock and roll album that proves that the Fab Four had their finger on current trends and a mastery of the genre - some of the harmonies are worthy of the Beach Boys - but it has few clues to suggest their future greatness.<br><br>Part of the album's problem is that half of it consists of cover versions, and the Beatles are clearly far more enthused by their own work. Twist and Shout suffers both from this - and the gruelling recording sessions - the worst, lacking energy compared to the breathtaking original. And of the Beatles' own compositions, only Love Me Do really stands out, though I Saw Her Standing There is superb rock and roll and PS I Love You has a very mild whiff of experimentation about it. The album's a good listen but it doesn't stay with you the way their later classics do.</span>,<span>From the raucous opening track ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to the party-like-it's-1963 cover of the Isley Brothers' ""Twist and Shout"", this debut album began the process of building the Beatles formula, by first throwing too many kitchen sinks into the stewing pot, then methodically streamlining the recipe into one with fewer, but more choice, ingredients. Because I cut my teeth on early Beatles music, I never get too upset when things don't quite work out in their growth and experimentation. <br><br>For instance, while Misery works, Anna (Go to Him) does not quite so well - it's okay, but plodding and vocally overwrought. No, Paul didn't quite have the chops on that one. While Chains is likable just because it's the Beatles, the original American version by The Cookies swung far better, its female vocals much more pleasing. Boys calls up a bop-shoo-op 50's rock'n'roll vibe. Ask Me Why croons harmoniously over plucky guitar rhythms and quietly taut percussion. Title track Please Please Me is quintessential Beatles, even with the flubbed lyric; slick and speedily paced, the song rocks along thanks to fun little guitar riffs and a soaring harmonica bit. Speaking of harmonica, Love Me Do makes steady use of that, including its now-famous solo; the song's sauntering tempo and singalong vocals are still ear-candy to me. P.S. I Love You is all about fine vocal interplay, this style borrowed from American pop acts, nicely melded into the Beatles template. <br><br>On the less successful side, U.S.-written hit Baby It's You feels clunky in the hands of the lads, weak backup vocals offering poor support for Paul's decent go at an impassioned lead. I've always been a sucker for the bass and guitar-work on Do You Want to Know a Secret; mind you, vocals seem spotty and the drumming feels hesitant and even awkward on the bridge. The cover of A Taste of Honey is charming in it's own way, the studio ambience lending primitive but nostalgic echo to the backup vocals; McCartney pretty much nails his parts here, and I particularly enjoy his take on the middle-eight. <br><br>There's a Place: Lennon's hoarse bellow nearly kills an otherwise neat little track, but Super Paul saves the day with stronger pipes. Crisp instrumentation serves the cause competently, George and Ringo shaking those bowl-haircuts to the bust-a-move harmonica outro. John's raspiness finds its place on the finale, Twist and Shout... yeah, it's classic Beatles for most folks, but I could pick dozens of Beatle songs I prefer to this one (and I'd defer to the Isley's original). Too much gravelly howling and screeching here. <br><br>To sum up: about half the album is classic tracks, there's a handful of hidden gems, and just a few near-stinkers round out the set. But this is essential for any real Beatles fan because some of the less obvious songs never appear on greatest hits collections.</span>,<span>My opinions, for whatever they are worth, on The Beatles' first lp:<br><br>1. There are two classics amongst the originals: ""Please Please Me"" was their first great single, and “I Saw Her Standing There” is almost indisputably one of the greatest Beatles tracks. Of the other originals, my favorite is “There’s a Place” with its wild harmonies and energetic performance. The rest are nothing special, pleasant enough, but not quite up to the songwriting standards of their later albums. “Love Me Do” was their first single of course, but it really doesn’t stand out and is probably in its proper element here as a decent lp track. <br><br>2. The Beatles did not always choose the best songs to cover, and excepting “Twist and Shout” that is the case here. John’s vocal on that song is justifiably praised, but he is strong on other tracks as well. Anna is not that great a song in the first place and the Beatles version is a bit leaden, but John’s vocal is expressive, especially on the bridge. Even their somewhat amateurish performance of “Baby It’s You” is lifted by his lead vocal. Likewise, Paul does a nice job on “A Taste Of Honey”, although I could do without the background “do-doot-en-doos.” Ringo’s strange version of “Boys” is much fun and is certainly one of his best vocal performances. <br><br>3. My opinion of this music has risen over the years. I first heard most of this on the inferior US issues Introducing the Beatles and The Early Beatles and that may have accounted for my initial skepticism. The UK issue is definitely the way to hear this music and the recent CD reissue sounds great, even in stereo. <br><br>4. This really is a pretty impressive debut, especially considering the time period and circumstances in which it was recorded. This, along with its its successor With the Beatles (Meet the Beatles in the USA), probably did more to switch the focus of rock fans from 45s to lps than any other lps. The Stones strong debut followed, other bands began to put more work into their albums, and within a couple of years rock lps were being taken seriously.</span>,<span>Of the 14, Five Songs Stand Out on Please Please Me.<br><br>It was 1963 and a sea-change took place in rock &amp; roll.  Four Rebels<br>-the Beatles-Johnny Rebel, Romantic Paulie, Mystic George and Ringo the lovable joker Reinvent rock &amp; roll when it becomes Classic Rock.  The Beatles were the first band that started the Rock era between 1963-80 and the five songs that sealed the deal are I Saw Her Standing There, the title cut, Love Me Do, the musical question Do You Want to Know a Secret? and the Immortal Twist and Shout-The Beatles with Five Statements revitalize, resurrect and reinvent Rock as an Art Form.  With the Fab Four taking a ragged and right approach to Rock, the music was ready for garages, stadiums and arenas.  Every current Rocker-U2, Madonna, Prince, Springsteen, Petty and Mellencamp-owes a debt of gratitude and thanks to the Beatles for making Rock what it is today, tomorrow and Forever because of Please Please Me.<br><br>The Beatles will Never Be Forgotten!

"<span>Album is over 50 years old, and can still be blasted in your home.<br>Great music.<br>It's The Beatles.  Masters of melody and harmony.<br>Fun love songs, fun rock songs, fun covers, 4 singers, and a solid debut release for the rock 'n roll era.<br>It's The Beatles.<br><br>9.0 A-</span>,<span>This is the point where you can distinguish between those who like the Beatles for their music and those who like the Beatles for the aura they emit or something ridiculous. When you have people literally admitting that the music is no good and then giving it 5 stars because ""it's the Beatles man!"" you know that you're in the presence of either nostalgic hippies who have gone through some sort of acid-induced psychological trauma or nostalg<em class=""rymfmt"">ia</em>-hippies (people who have been brainwashed by nostalg<em class=""rymfmt"">ic</em> hippies --coughrollingstonecough-- who have gone through some sort of acid-induced psychological trauma). And it's a surprisingly large percentage of the population.<br><br>Most of the music here is unbearably generic 50s doo-wop rock. The lyrics are mindless, the music plods along with very little hint of originality or charisma, with the big exception of Love Me Do. <br><br>Strange, what was bubbling underneath the surface.</span>,<span>How many pop albums from 1963 are still listenable? Check the chart for 1963 - all the albums ranked above this one are jazz and soul, which age much more slowly. The Beatles' debut contains a number of outstanding original tracks, as well as some well-done covers, and the album as a whole comes through with a tremendous amount of energy, as it is basically live (it was recorded in one 13-hour session, if you don't already know). The sound that The Beatles achieved on this album was so fresh that it kicked off the exciting era of modern music that developed in the 60's and 70's, and amazingly, The Beatles only got better.</span>,<span>El debut de los cuatro chavales de Liverpool es la hoja de ruta que marcaría a una generación entera. La perfección del rock &amp; roll de pub, transmitiendo a de maravilla esa sensación de directo que amenizaba las veladas de taberna en The Cavern Club o las noches de Hamburgo.<br><br>Grabado en apenas unas diez horas, contiene los elementos que marcarían el resto de la historia de la banda en sus futuras obras maestras y maratonianas sesiones de estudio. Su implacable hambre desde el principio les obligaba a incluir canciones de su propio repertorio, siendo estas las mejores del disco sin duda, lo cual es un logro enorme. Piezas ya clásicas como ''I Saw Her Standing There'' o ''Misery'' comenzaban a salir del tandem compositivo más aclamado de la historia, los Lennon/McCartney. Con ''Please Please Me'' o ''Love Me Do'' incluso iban ya más lejos y comenzaban a ver, junto a su productor George Martin, que el estudio era algo más que un simple lugar donde ir a grabar, y que podía ser el instrumento definitivo.<br><br>Había hueco incluso para que George Harrison colara su primera canción, ''Do You Want To Know A Secret'', o para que Ringo Starr cantara su versión de ''Boys''. Todo muy democrático, demostrando que cuando la banda estaba unida eran totalmente imparables. Entre los covers hay obras maestras como ''Anna (Go To Him)'' o la versión definitiva de ''Twist And Shout'', donde comienzan a usar el truco que les acompañaría toda la vida de colocar canciones así como ultima pista del álbum.<br><br>Acababan de empezar y ya sonaban a The Beatles. Ya tenían un sonido totalmente reconocible. Ya tenían un disco enorme bajo el brazo. Comenzaba la Beatlemania y con ella gran parte de la historia del siglo XX.<br><br>9/10<br><br>BLOG: <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://45yomusic.blogspot.com"" target=""_blank"">http://45yomusic.blogspot.com</a><br>FORO: <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://45yomusic.comuv.com"" target=""_blank"">http://45yomusic.comuv.com</a></span>,<span>A very enjoyable album full of rock and roll and R&amp;B tunes. The two best songs are probably 'Please Please Me' and 'I Saw Her Standing There'. I really like the solo on the latter. It kinda makes you get up and dance.<br><br>I also liked the covers, my favourites being 'Anna' (really nice little riff, tho some people think it's crap), 'Twist and Shout' (their most famous cover) and 'Baby It's You'.<br><br>There are some decent ballads on here, such as 'PS I Love You' (which has a slight Spanish flavour to it) and 'Chains' (another R&amp;B cover). 'Ask Me Why' is ok tho its not that exciting but an easy listen really. 'There's a Place' is a really nice song, which is quite sweet. 'Do You want to know a Secret' is similar in that its not overly complicated but a good listen nonetheless.<br><br>The drawbacks of this album are that although the songs are nice to listen to, they're not that memorable and seem like filler, which was probably the case because the record companies tended to rush releases back then. The song i least like is probably 'Misery' cos it seems very unoriginal in its melody for me. Also, I personally think 'Love Me Do' is a bit crap and i dont know why they released it as a single. <br><br>However, this is a good album to listen to and i can see iwhy it got to Number 1 and stayed there. Very good for a first album, but it was always gonna be for the band that changed the world of music. ;)</span>,<span>Si je devais résumer cet album en un adjectif (et la période <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> de 1963 à 1966), je dirais que c'est MIELLEUX. A partir de 1967 c'est la fête aux champignons et aux délires hallucinogènes en tous genres. Bref, ce 1er LP des gars de Liverpool est bien gentillet, destiné à la bonne société conservatrice anglaise et aux jeunes adolescentes propres sur elles, mais bon soyons sérieux. S'ils s'étaient appelés The Ploucks et qu'ils étaient venus du Honduras, on n'en aurait jamais parlé et fait tout un plat ! <strong class=""rymfmt""><em class=""rymfmt"">Please, Please Me</em></strong> est déjà un nom d'album déjà niais en-soi, son contenu...no comment.</span>,<span>I love poppy early Beatles but with a few exceptions I think their debut is actually one of their weaker pre-Rubber Soul efforts.</span>,<span>Soy conocido entre mis amigos que gustan del rock y el “buen arte” como el anti-beatle. Muchas veces se me acusa de exagerar los puntos bajos del grupo, y de menospreciar su música. Pero tal vez esta reseña deje en claro mi punto de vista del grupo.<br>  Siempre me mantuve distante de la primera etapa de los Beatles, pero no puedo considerar que se de rock si no escuché estos discos. No quiero explayarme, ya que cuando termine de reseñar todos los lanzamientos de los Beatles haré una introducción al grupo en la que explicaré todo esto detalladamente.<br>  Ya todos saben la historia de los Beatles, así que no creo necesario repetirla.<br>   No suelo hablar de las letras de grupos extranjeros, y si lo voy a hacer, no va a ser en este disco ya que no hay ninguna que sea verdaderamente relevante (confesiones de amor, expresiones de las emociones sentidas al besar a una chica y esas estupideces de adolescentes).<br><br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">I saw her standing there</strong>, un rock ‘n’ roll movido, abre el disco con una pegadiza melodía y unas guitarras distorsionadas. Los típicos e identificatorios coros Beatle se hacen presentes en esta canción junto con un solo de guitarra insulso e inexpresivo.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Misery</strong> es un tema compuesto originalmente para Helen Shapiro que tiene una melodía melosa unos coros agradables y un piano extremadamente infantil. Es algo monótono, pero su corta duración lo hace algo disfrutable.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt""> Anna (go to him)</strong> es otro pop romántico esta vez mucho mejor. El estribillo con su melodía apasionada y el pegadizo riff de guitarra presente en las estrofas hacen a este tema un highlight.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Chains</strong> es un pop con tintes country plagado de coros y melodías amistosas. Es el segundo cover del disco, y si bien no es destacable, tampoco merece ser lowlight.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Boys </strong>es otro cover, y está muy bien cantado por Ringo Starr. Posee unos coros pegadizos y una base bastante blusera. Esta vez el solo ejecutado por Harrison es mucho más destacable, y aunque es nuevamente inexpresivo, queda muy bien con el ritmo apresurado del bajo y la batería. Sin embargo la melodía, su elemento principal, no alcanza a ser demasiado buena.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Ask me why</strong> es un pop meloso bastante destacable por su hermosa melodía y sus infaltablemente pegadizos coros. Una canción muy bien lograda: base tranquila y performance vocal perfecta.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt""> Please please me</strong> es otro highlight que posee un estribillo muy pegadizo con unos “come on!” desgarrados y apasionantes, unos inevitablemente geniales coros y una pegadiza melodía.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Love me do</strong> es el primer número uno de los Beatles. Muy sobrevalorado, tiene una armónica amistosa y una pandereta tonta ejecutada por Ringo (aunque sólo es un detalle). El solo de John es muy bueno, eso no se niega.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">P.S. I love you</strong> es una hermosa balada romántica con una conjugación perfecta entre los coros y la voz líder. Si no fuera porque se hace extensa, la marcaría en rojo con gusto. Además el acompañamiento termina siendo agotador.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Baby it’s you</strong> es un cover que comienza con unos coros ultra infantiles y una apasionante melodía. Pero lo mejor aquí es el estribillo, cantado a la perfección por John. El catarro lo ayuda a desgarrar fácilmente su voz (aunque esto se puede ver mejor en el último tema), y eso queda muy bien. El solo de guitarra es aborrecible, pero por suerte dura poco.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Do you want to know a secret</strong> es simplemente maravillosa. Me arrodillo ante una de las melodías más pegadizas, amistosas, amorosas y agradables de la historia del pop-rock. Un tema con esta parte de voz no puede ser otra cosa que highlight.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">A taste of honey</strong> tiene unos coros vigorosos con ritmo de marcha, una melodía que pretende ser tétrica pero que al estar rodeada de temas como Please please me o Do you want to know a secret no puede ser tomada con seriedad.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">There’s a place</strong> es muy movida y tiene unos coros geniales con melodías divertidas. El estribillo es, curiosamente, lo menos destacable. John saca a relucir nuevamente su armónica, pero esta vez no logra cautivarnos como antes: aporta sencillos detalles.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Twist and shout</strong> es lo mejor del disco. No hay cosa más bailable que ésta. La voz locamente desgarrada de John y los sencillos pero lindos coros son ultra cautivadores. Además el popular riff de guitarra nuevamente pegadizo nos hace saltar de emoción para bailar y el solo de guitarra es el mejor de todos en este LP.<br><br>  Aunque la música del disco sea simple, Please please me es un compilado de pop juvenil con melodías geniales y música fresca y disfrutable. A los cuatro jóvenes les falta trayectoria para madurar y lograr constituir discos sólidos, pero para comenzar es un buen LP.<br>  No pienso explicar la concepción que tengo de este disco en relación a su lugar en la historia del rock, ya que lo voy a hacer, como dije antes, en la introducción al grupo. Sólo puedo decir que con este LP los Beatles se popularizaron a gran escala y movilizaron millones de chicas (y también de billetes) con su música.<br>  Ahora, por favor, no me digan que no fueron comerciales. No digo que hayan sido malos, pero este grupo es uno de los más vendedores de imagen en la historia del rock. Los Beatles eran los jóvenes de pelo largo y flequillo loco, eran el furor de las jóvenes. Con esto no quiero decir que sea un grupo de mala calidad, ni que sean uno más entre todas las bandas: simplemente quiero expresar que lucraron como pocos lo han hecho en la historia del rock.<br>  Además, la manía Beatle no fue sólo en E.E.U.U y Europa, como suele serlo: todo el mundo se movilizó. Prueba de esto es lo que cuentan mis abuelos: tenían en esa época una disquería en un pueblo perdido de Entre Ríos, Argentina, y dicen que se armaban colas gigantes de compradores cuando llegaban los vinilos de los cuatro aclamados. Si no me creen, basta con preguntar a adultos de unos 40 o 50 años para comprobar que esto era verdad.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Puntuación: 7-<br><br>Mejor canción: Twist and shout<br><br>Highlights:</strong> I saw her standing there; Anna (go to him); Ask me why; Please please me; Do you want to know a secret?; Twist and shout.</span>"
"<span>I feel like a tool for hating on old pop Beatles because I always get mad at people who are super pompous about liking their later stuff over their more strictly pop era, but man, this album is NOT good. Three of the hits are really good-""Please Please Me,"" Love Me Do"" and ""P.S. I Love You,"" all right next to each other conveniently enough-and the rest ranges from forgettable to stupid to downright grating. Definitely a rocky start.</span>,<span>Sì, le canzoni possono risultare banali, stupide, per ragazzine,<br>ma...hey, siamo nel '63.<br>Dai, non è male.<br>E poi questo è probabilmente il primo vero album Merseybeat, nonchè uno dei primi Beat (se non il primo).<br>Comunque se questo album lo avesse fatto una qualunque altra band magari decisamente meno famosa rispetto ai Beatles, sono sicuro che molta gente che lo odia, almeno gli darebbe la sufficenza, bah oramai è diventata una moda dire che qualunque cosa dei Beatles è spazzatura.<br><br>Analizziamo:<br>I Saw Her Standing There |  4<br>Misery                           |  2<br>Anna (Go to Him)            |  4<br>Chains                           |  1,5<br>Boys                              |  4<br>Ask Me Why                    |  3,5<br>Please Please Me             |  3,5 <br>Love Me Do                     |  3,5<br>P.S.

A stunning debut. Not as good as later Beatles' albums but that doesn't mean it's not a classic. It contains ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Twist And Shout"", and ""Please Please Me"", three drop dead classic tunes. This early guitar pop masterpiece also contains ""Misery"", ""There's A Place"", and their covers of ""Baby It's You"" and ""Anna(Go To Him)"", all of which are perfect little pop ditties. The closest this album comes to a bad song is ""A Taste Of Honey"" and even that song is ok. This is The Beatles, you can't review this the way you would a normal album because  the mythology of the band itself gets in the way. You have people either deliberately underrating Beatles' albums (for spite? I don't know) and at the same time you have true believers who rate everything The Beatles did as a 5. I tried to look at this objectively but it's hard. The songs are so familiar it's as if they are part of me,and, in a way, they are. So my ""as objective as possible"" review is 3.5 stars. It's Food but they will do a lot better.</span>,<span>Please Please Me is really one of those albums I find to be both overlooked and revolutionary at the same time. I mean 3.57, are you kidding this album has I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, and Twist and Shout, that's at least worth a 3.70. Plus it was the start to one of, if not the greatest, rock band in the history of music. Four sarcastic college aged adults emerged from the streets of Liverpool, struggling to land a record deal, and when they finally got their break they released this album along with a few singles yet failed to chart. British bands just weren't big in America yet, we were still listening to our own Motown and innocent sounding teenage pop rock. However, Please Please Me was as solid a release as any other British invasion band of that time, despite a few set backs. <br><br>It opens up with one of the strongest Beatles' songs, I Saw Her Standing There, which has an incredible rhythm and some of the greatest guitar work of its time. Please Please Me really speaks for itself with the legendary harmonica riff and harmonies. P.S. I Love You is the start to Paul's ballads he'd become known for. Do You Want to Know a Secret is a bit cheesy but something about it just sounds so sincere and has catchy harmonies. Ask Me Why has an interesting jazzy kind of feel, and even Love Me Do has an interesting harmonica riff that would influence the Stones a little. <br><br>Of course half the album is covers and that's the downside, but they aren't bad covers unlike the Beatles' next few albums. Anna has some pretty nice vocals by John, Chains has a catchy beat, even if it is a bit forgettable,  and Twist and Shout will forever go down in history as one of the greatest cover songs after hearing John destroy his vocals singing the hell out of this one. Although for the decent covers you have a couple of bad ones, Boys is Ringos first song and is just a forgettable filler song with some cringe worthy vocals, Baby It's You is another forgettable slow ballad, and There's a Place while being somewhat pleasant is also a tad bit forgettable. <br><br>So Please Please Me is far from being a great album, it has many great moments that would show potential for the Beatles' future career. It opens and ends on strong notes and the sound is pretty unique for its time. It's just a shame this tends to get overlooked when it has plenty of great moments, even if it does have a couple of weaker ones.</span>,<span>Early 60's pop/rock without much interesting about it at all. I ahve this on vinyl because my mum had it and bequeathed it to me. She's pretty old so she fucking loves the Beatles and insists that good music pretty much ended when they broke up blah blah stop being stuck in a time-warp, woman. There's not a lot that I've considered special about the beatles. At best, they were quite interesting, at least when their messing around with stuff worked (which it didn't sometimes.) and at worst they were pretty pedestrian pop. Yeah, you can bang on about songcraft et al, but that's not something that interests me awfully.<br><br>If I'm being totally honest, I'd rather not listen to this again. It's pretty boring, and I honestly don't care much for straight-up pop from any era, really. It's always confused me as to why the Beatles are still considsered worthy of worship - indeed, considered untouchable and practically sacred by some people. At lest they got a bit more interesting after this debut.</span>,<span>Ahhhh, los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>. Ustedes sabrán que yo los considero la mejor banda de rock de todos los tiempos. Pues bien, hablar de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> es jugar con fuego. Deséenme suerte.<br>En primer lugar, hasta el más tenaz anti-<strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> deberá admitir que son el grupo más trascendente del rock, y tal vez de la historia. Su fama es inconmensurable, desmedida, y en ocasiones es lo único que la gente conoce del vasto mundo del rock. Esta sobrevaloración es uno de los principales motivos por los que mucha gente los rechaza. Tal vez si fuesen un grupo oscuro, under, esa misma gente los adoraría, pero eso no lo puedo saber, así que sigamos. <br>Es indudable que los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> están sobrevalorados. Aunque tal vez lo que pasa es que los otros grupos están infravalorados. Es decir, después de todo está bien que la mejor banda de rock sea recordada todo el tiempo. En todo caso, hay miles de grupos buenos que no reciben los constantes halagos que recibe el cuarteto de Liverpool, y tal vez en ese aspecto los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> estén sobrevalorados, pero eso no significa que no se merezcan todos los lisonjeos que reciben. <br>Otra de las causas del odio hacia la banda es su aparente simpleza. Hay muchos elitistas que no conciben una música simple, “pop”, y sólo se arrodillan ante aquellos que son capaces de lanzar 20.000 notas por segundo o hacer suites de 4352 minutos donde fusionen el rock con la música clásica, el jazz, músicas tribales africanas y música cavernícola. Ese tipo de gente no puede soportar que una banda que haya hecho temas azucarados, simples, con melodías empalagosas, letras execrables y haya tenido miles de fans mujeres que los adoraban por sus flequillos, sea considerado el mejor de la historia. <br>Obviamente no lo comparto. En primer lugar, me gustaría terminar de una vez por todas con el odio constante hacia la primera etapa de la banda, ya que no lo logro entender. Sí, era simple pop, empalagoso, dulce, simplón y adolescente. ¿Y qué? Por si no lo recuerdan, eran los 60. El rock estaba muerto, lisa y llanamente. Los héroes de la década del 50 estaban o muertos o hundidos en la oscuridad más oscura, y los baladistas copaban nuevamente la parada. ¿Qué pretendían qué hagan? ¿Rock pesado? Me parece una crítica totalmente sacada de contexto. Obviamente, si el día de hoy un grupo saca un disco con canciones como <em class=""rymfmt"">All My Loving</em> o <em class=""rymfmt"">I Want To Hold Your Hand</em>, sería más que ridículo. Pero era otra época, recuérdenlo. ¿Y acaso los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> no ayudaron a cambiar el paradigma? ¿De dónde salieron bandas como los <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_who/"" target=""_blank"">Who</a>, los <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_kinks/"" target=""_blank"">Kinks</a> o hasta los <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_rolling_stones/"" target=""_blank"">Stones</a>? ¡De los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>! ¿Quién influyó a <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/jimi_hendrix/"" target=""_blank"">Jimi Hendrix</a>, a los <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_beach_boys/"" target=""_blank"">Beach Boys</a>, a todo el incipiente rock sudamericano, e inspiró a muchas de las nacientes bandas de rock progresivo? Que los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> no hayan sido completamente revolucionarios no significa que no hayan sido influyentes, sino todo lo contrario. Su música nunca fue experimental, nunca fue totalmente anti-comercial, y es cierto también que en la misma época que salía <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Pepper’s</em> salían álbumes mucho más revolucionarios, experimentales y jugados. Pero los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> no necesitaron romper todas las barreras existentes para revolucionar el mundo de la música. <br>Porque si hay algo que no se puede negar, es que hubo un antes y después de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> en la historia de la música popular. El beat de sus primeras épocas, si bien estaba influido tanto por las baladas románticas como por el viejo rock and roll, cambió por completo la escena musical del momento, abrió las puertas a millones de grupos nacientes de Inglaterra y provocó la explosión definitiva del rock, al punto tal que sin esa etapa de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, tan comercial y chiclosa en apariencia, tal vez no hubiese habido nada después. Dirán que estoy exagerando, pero ¿cuántos álbumes de rock genuinos había antes de la salida de <strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong>? ¿Y cuántas bandas se tomaron del éxito de los Beatles para lanzar su carrera? <br>En su segunda etapa, no fueron tan revolucionarios, y está sobrevalorada en ese sentido. Yo creo que su revolución en esta etapa no pasa tanto por música “revolucionaria”. Suena contradictorio, ¿no?. Pues bien, me parece que sus intentos revolucionarios en su segunda etapa fueron a veces muy originales, pero fueron sin duda menos revolucionarios que los que en la misma época hacían gente como <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/jimi_hendrix/"" target=""_blank"">Jimi Hendrix</a>, <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/syd_barrett/"" target=""_blank"">Syd Barrett</a>, <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/eric_clapton/"" target=""_blank"">Eric Clapton</a> o <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/lou_reed/"" target=""_blank"">Lou Reed</a>. Los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> tuvieron sus momentos verdaderamente subversivos y originales (<em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em> en general, el medley del lado B de <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution 9</em>), pero no fueron tan revolucionarios en ese sentido como los artistas anteriormente mencionados. Sin embargo, también se podría afirmar que fueron el grupo más influyente de la época. ¿Cómo se puede influir sin ser original? Muy fácil: con arte. Los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> inauguraron la idea “artística” del rock, de eso no me caben dudas. ¿Me podrían decir un disco anterior a <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> con una concepción y una consistencia tan grandiosa? Es imposible, porque anteriormente, la idea de un disco era “single del momento+composiciones de relleno+covers de rythm &amp; blues”, y las letras eran, como mínimo, infantiles, generalmente diciendo obviedades sobre relaciones amorosas adolescentes. Podrán decir que <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/bob_dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob Dylan</a> fue el verdadero revolucionario en ese sentido, pero <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/bob_dylan/"" target=""_blank"">Bob</a> era folk estadounidense, y en el sentido estricto del género “rock”, es indudable que los que iniciaron la etapa artística del rock, fueron los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>. Esto se puede demostrar con la gran cantidad de influencias que cosecharon: prácticamente no hay grupo que no haya reconocido sus influencias del cuarteto de Liverpool. Entonces, si bien es una exageración decir que son el grupo más revolucionario de la historia, es imposible negar su influencia en todo el espectro del rock. <br>Por otra parte, mucha gente también critica la simpleza de sus canciones. Es verdad: sus canciones son generalmente simples, y no tenían ningún virtuoso en sus filas. Pero, a mi manera de ver, en el pop/rock no se necesita tanto el virtuosismo de los miembros (como si lo necesitan mucho más, por ejemplo, el rock progresivo o el hard rock), sino calidad en materia compositiva. Y es imposible negar que los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> fueron los mejores compositores de canciones de la historia. No hubo un grupo que haga las melodías que hacían los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>; no hubo un grupo con una variedad de arreglos tan pasmosa como los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>; no hubo un grupo tan versátil como los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>; no hubo un grupo tan consistente como los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>. <br>La pareja Lennon-McCartney es claramente el mejor dúo compositivo de la historia del rock. Simplemente fíjense en los discos de la segunda etapa de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>: cada uno contiene al menos 6 himnos. Y cuando digo himnos, digo himnos de verdad. De cualquier banda, uno podría hacer una lista de 15 canciones brillantes, épicas, sublimes. De los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, en cambio, sería prácticamente imposible elegir sus 30 mejores canciones. <br>La consistencia de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> en ese sentido es increíble. La seguidilla de discos que va desde <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> hasta <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em> es inalcanzable en todo sentido. Seis discos (más los singles, que todos juntos sumarían otro más) en 4 años, todos obras maestras, todos influyentes, todos distintos. Una seguidilla así no se vio nunca en la historia del rock; qué se yo, no se compara con nada. Y eso que hubo miles de bandas excelentes, cada una con una seguidilla de discos brillantes. Pero no se pueden acercar siquiera a la perfección que tuvo la segunda etapa de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>. Me imagino lo que debía sentir un joven de esa época: esperar los discos de los <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</em> debía ser una experiencia cuasi-religiosa. Uno se debía preparar, concientizado de que sacarían algo totalmente distinto al disco anterior, y creía intuir el camino que tomaría la banda; pero, invariablemente, siempre terminaba sorprendido y, meneándo la cabeza, se debía decir “No puede ser, éstos hijos de puta lo hicieron de nuevo”. No tuve el privilegio de sentirlo, pero supongo que debía de ser algo parecido. <br>Además de ser brillantes compositivamente, eran variados: como ya expliqué en la revisión de <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/queen/queen/"" target=""_blank"">Queen</a>, no eran “variados por etapas”, sino que cada disco suyo era algo totalmente nuevo. Es realmente admirable que hayan hecho primero un disco pop, luego un disco rockero, ácido y revolucionario, luego un dúo de discos psicodélicos, un disco faraónico que aglutina todos los géneros anteriormente nombrados y miles más, y un disco rockero, emocional y virtualmente perfecto. ¡Y todos obras maestras! ¿Hay acaso algo más versátil que esa seguidilla de clásicos? <br>Entonces, creo que los que aseguran que los Beatles fueron una banda de “pop cursi”, deberían considerarlo un poco. Y también deberían escuchar temas como <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist And Shout</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Taxman</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Back In The USSR</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Yer Blues</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Helter Skelter</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Come Together</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I Want You</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">The End</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Hey Bulldog</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Day Tripper</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I Me Mine</em>, etc, y luego preguntarse si de verdad no rockeaban. Ya hablé de sus virtudes: la composición y la variedad. <br>No hay muchas más virtudes para nombrar aquí, ya que las miles de cualidades más están mejor presentadas en cada disco que en un resumen general del grupo. Así que me pondré a hablar de cada integrante. <br>Antes que nada, aviso que no voy a tomar una postura en la dicotomía “John vs. Paul”. A alguno le podrá gustar más John, a otro Paul, pero sinceramente no veo que uno sea mejor que el otro. En realidad, se complementaban perfectamente: no se puede tomar a uno como “mejor” que el otro, sino que los dos son uno solo. Esto se ve demostrado en sus carreras solistas, que fueron muy buenas pero no lograron el nivel demostrado en los Beatles. Simplemente eran el uno para el otro, y no era sino juntos que daban lo mejor de sí. <br>Ahora sí, los integrantes. Empecemos con John. Compositivamente, ya he dicho que podría ser uno de los mejores compositores de rock de la historia. La cantidad de canciones y melodías brillantes que ideó es interminable: <em class=""rymfmt"">You've Got To Hide Your Love Away</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Ticket To Ride</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Norwegian Wood</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Nowhere Man</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">In My Life</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I’m Only Sleeping</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">She Said She Said</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">And Your Bird Can Sing</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Tomorrow Never Knows</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Day In The Life</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I Am The Walrus</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Strawberry Fields Forever</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">All You Need Is Love</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Dear Prudence</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Happiness Is A Warm Gun</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Julia</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Yer Blues</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Sexy Sadie</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Cry Baby Cry</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Come Together</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I Want You</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Because</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Across The Universe</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Day Tripper</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Rain</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Don’t Let Me Down</em>… Fue el Beatle al que más le picó el bicho de la psicodelia, y como consecuencia las canciones más experimentales, ácidas y revolucionarias se las debemos a él. Además, era también algo más rockero que Paul. Generalmente, estas cualidades son tomadas como argumento para la idea de que John era mejor que Paul, descalificando a éste último como un compositor de “pop azucarado”. Pues bien, esto es una falacia: Paul también tuvo temas muy rockeros, hizo suites multi-parte, hizo baladas desgarradoras. A algunos les podrá gustar más el hecho de que John haya tenido una veta “arriesgada”, pero no es tampoco un justificativo de la superioridad de Lennon. Instrumentalmente no se destacaba mucho: tocaba bien la guitarra y el piano, pero no era muy remarcable. Su highlight era su voz: es uno de mis cantantes favoritos de todos los tiempos. No es una voz tan inhumana y brillante como la de, por ejemplo, <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/freddie_mercury/"" target=""_blank"">Freddy Mercury</a>, pero posee un estilo tan distintivo, que es imposible confundirnos. Suena muy arrogante, con un dejo sutil de sarcasmo, que puede hacernos llorar (<em class=""rymfmt"">Julia</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Because</em>) o gritar de rabia (<em class=""rymfmt"">Twist And Shout</em>). John sí que sabía cantar números rockeros: <em class=""rymfmt"">Yer Blues</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist And Shout</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution</em>, entre otras, lo testifican. Letrísitcamente, puede tener tanto instropecciones personales desgarradoras (<em class=""rymfmt"">Julia</em>), declaraciones universalistas (<em class=""rymfmt"">All You Need Is Love</em>), o dementes letras psicodélicas (<em class=""rymfmt"">I Am The Walrus</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds</em>). <br>Y si enumeré las grandes canciones que John le legó al mundo, por qué no enumerar las de Paul (total estoy aburrido): <em class=""rymfmt"">Yesterday</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">I’m Looking Through You</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Eleanor Rigby</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Here There And Everywhere</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">For No One</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Getting Better</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Fixing A Hole</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">The Fool On The Hill</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Penny Lane</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Martha My Dear</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Blackbird</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Helter Skelter</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Oh! Darling</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">You Never Give Me Your Money</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Golden Slumbers</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">The Long And Winding Road</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">We Can Work It Out</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Paperback Writer</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Lady Madonna</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Hey Jude</em>…¿Hay alguien que haga mejores melodías que Paul? No lo creo. Podrán criticar a Paul por ser tan “pop”, pero la cantidad de melodías pegadizas que creó es innumerable. ¿El mejor compositor pop de todos los tiempos? Es muy probable. Además, es bastante tonto decir que Paul hace sólo ""pop cursi"" cuando quizá era el más vanguardista de los Beatles, siendo él el que tuvo la idea de los loops eléctronicos en Tomorrow Never Knows, el que impulsó la extensa y hasta ahora nunca publicada canción experimental ""Carnival Of Light"" y que más tarde sacó álbumes experimentales bajo el seudónimo de ""The Fireman"" y hasta tuvo incursiones en la música clásica (Liverpool Oratorio). Su voz es muy bella, y aunque demostró que es muy competente en el rock o el blues (<em class=""rymfmt"">Oh Darling</em>), es en las baladas donde saca a relucir su preciosidad, brindando algunas performances alucinantes (<em class=""rymfmt"">For No One</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Martha My Dear</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em>). Es también un gran bajista (escuchar los punteos endemoniados de I Want You para saber de qué hablo), y tocaba de manera bellísima el piano, con algunas líneas clásicas como la que abre <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em>. Es también muy infravalorado como letrista. Sé que algunas de sus letras dan vergüenza (<em class=""rymfmt"">Hello Goodbye</em>), pero tiene algunas poesías hermosas (<em class=""rymfmt"">Blackbird</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Fixing A Hole</em>), letras desgarradoras y melancólicas (<em class=""rymfmt"">Eleanor Rigby</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">For No One</em>), o luminosas letras optimistas y brillantes (<em class=""rymfmt"">Hey Jude</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em>). <br>Mucha gente dice que George era un genio al nivel de la pareja Lennon-McCartney, pero estoy en desacuerdo. Sí, tuvo algunas canciones en las que alcanzó el nivel del dúo, pero fueron muy pocas. Puedo admitir que <em class=""rymfmt"">While My Guitar Gently Weeps</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Something</em> y <em class=""rymfmt"">Here Comes The Sun</em> son de las mejores canciones de todos los tiempos, pero no basta para alcanzar la cantidad inconmensurable de himnos compuesta por John y Paul. Algunos dicen que era muy postergado y sólo sacaba dos temas por disco, y si todos los temas que sacó fueran obras maestras, lo creería, pero si bien no tuvo grandes traspiés (sólo se me ocurre <em class=""rymfmt"">For You Blue</em>), sus canciones fueron aceptables, buenas y muy buenas, pero nunca alcanzaron un nivel excelente (exceptuando las tres antes mencionadas). Aclarado esto, no dejaré de reconocer que es un muy buen compositor, y muy versátil, ya que podía hacer rock furioso (<em class=""rymfmt"">Taxman</em>), blues pesado (<em class=""rymfmt"">Savoy Truffle</em>), baladas acústicas (<em class=""rymfmt"">Long Long Long</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Here Comes The Sun</em>), baladas románticas (<em class=""rymfmt"">Something</em>), temas hindúes (<em class=""rymfmt"">Love You To</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Within You Without You</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">The Inner Light</em>), u oscuros collages psicodélicos (<em class=""rymfmt"">Only A Northern Song</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">It’s All Too Much</em>), aunque luego se vería atraído por las baladas, tendencia que se vería acentuada en su carrera solista. Es también un gran guitarrista, con algunos solos brillantes como el de <em class=""rymfmt"">Come Together</em> o el de <em class=""rymfmt"">Something</em>, o riffs asesinos como el de <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolution</em>. Sus letras siempre fueron muy espirituales, hablando del amor y de las relaciones entre las personas en general (aunque también tuvo su buena dosis de iracundas letras políticas, como <em class=""rymfmt"">Piggies</em> o <em class=""rymfmt"">Taxman</em>). <br>Ringo Starr es un buen baterista, con algunos momentos descollantes como <em class=""rymfmt"">Rain</em> o <em class=""rymfmt"">A Day In The Life</em>, pero es obviamente el miembro menos talentoso, y tuvo suerte de estar al lado de tamaños genios. Cumple, simplemente. Compositivamente, aportó la divertida <em class=""rymfmt"">Octopus’s Garden</em> y la insoportable <em class=""rymfmt"">Don’t Pass Me By</em>, y su voz es ciertamente torpe. Pero bueno, a todo el mundo le cae bien Ringo, ¿no? <br>En fin, si aún te rehusás a admitir la genialidad de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, vos te lo perdés. Yo seguiré disfrutando de un grupo que lo tiene todo: rock, melodías, variedad, emocionalidad, calidad compositiva, influencia, experimentación, resonancia, accesibilidad, un estilo distintivo y, por sobre todas las cosas, 7 obras maestras que no se pueden pasar por alto. Dos de ellas forman parte de mis discos favoritos de toda la historia. Ninguna otra banda logró eso. Yo sé que es un cliché, pero los Beatles nunca van a morir. Tal vez el rock muera, pero los Beatles no. Hoy en día el rock está dormido, y va decayendo de a poco, pero los fans de los Beatles siguen apareciendo de a mares por todos lados. Es que los Beatles trascendieron las fronteras del rock (y de la música). Los Beatles son como la Santísima Trinidad. Son cuatro, pero a la vez son uno. Y los Beatles son más famosos que la Santísima Trinidad (aunque no sé si más que Jesucristo). Son famosos y van a seguir siendo famosos. Su música y el legado que dejaron es perpetuo. Y cuando el último de ellos muera, los cuatro se reunirán en el cielo y volverán a tocar, regando con su música a todo el mundo. Aunque no se necesita todo eso. Sólo basta con poner play a cualquiera de sus discos. En fin, escuchalos. Simplemente escuchalos. <br>Este es un gran disco debut, para su época. Al día de hoy puede sonar insulso, superficial y muy comercial, pero hay que tener en cuenta que en la época de este disco, el rock estaba prácticamente muerto. Los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, entre otros grupos de la Invasión Británica, ayudaron a resucitarlo, y el punto de partida fue este álbum, consolidándose los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> como los impulsores de la música beat. <br>En fin, <strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong> es un álbum liviano de pop con algunos números de rock and roll, pero se vislumbra ya una calidad en la banda superior a la de los (pocos) rivales que tenían en ese momento. <br>Comienza con un conteo clásico, ese genial ""One, two, three, four"", que anuncia que estamos ante algo diferente. Es <strong class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</strong>, un rock and roll con mucha energía juvenil y un gran estribillo. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Misery</strong> es una balada con letra pesimista (aunque aún juvenil) y melodía alegre, mientras que <strong class=""rymfmt"">Anna (Go To Him)</strong> cuenta con una gran performance vocal de John y una buena guitarra acústica. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Chains</strong> es relleno, especialmente por su tonta armónica, mientras que <strong class=""rymfmt"">Boys</strong>, también relleno, es más disfrutable, un rock and roll genérico con una buena voz de Ringo. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Ask Me Why</strong> es otro numerito pop inocuo pero disfrutable, antes de dar paso a otro gran clásico del álbum, <strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong>, con su armónica clásica, sus ""C'mon c'mon"" verdaderamente irresistibles, y su melodía brillante. El segundo mejor tema del disco. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do</strong> está bien, es pegadiza, pero está algo sobrevalorada. <br>Prefiero <strong class=""rymfmt"">P.S.I Love You</strong>, otra balada azucarada con una voz muy grave de Paul y una melodía no tan monótona como la anterior. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Baby It's You</strong> es una balada muy empalagosa pero que a veces se disfruta por los irresistibles ""Shalalalalalala"". <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Do You Want To Know A Secret</strong> es una buena canción pop con una muy pegadiza melodía y buenos coros.<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">There's A Place</strong> es mediocre, con una buena melodía pero algo bulliciosa para mi gusto. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">A Taste Of Honey</strong> es un tema raro, con ritmo de vals en los versos, que me gusta mucho por su originalidad. <br>Para el final reservaron lo mejor, el cover <strong class=""rymfmt"">Twist And Shout</strong>, pero lo que era un número ordinario lo transforman en un rock and roll desenfrenado con uno de los picos de la voz de Lennon, totlamente fogosa y salvaje. Un número bastante rockero para 1963, si me preguntan. <br>Y así termina este buen disco pop, un disco que no será una obra maestra (ni tiene pretensiones de serlo) pero otorga grandes cuotas de disfrute al oyente. Un 7+.<br>Mejor canción: Twist And Shout<br>Highlights: I Saw Her Standing There, Anna (Go To Him), Please Please Me, Twist And Shout<br>Lowlights: Chains, There's A Place</span>,<span>Not as daring as their later work but full of enthusiasm and great songwriting, comes one of Merseybeat's defining records and shows what all the fuss was about. Although one or two tracks aren't up to par, they don't drag the record down, by being just alright.</span>"
"<span>Good thing the Beatles evolved into greater and more complex things, because if it were for these songs they would have been buried among the hundreds of pop bands of the 60s. We can't deny the power of some of their compositions, though.</span>,<span>I try to describe album who was listened and analyzed by everyone. That's not easy. The Beatles is the band which has already said everything. Adjectives like energetic, brilliant or fantastic was everywhere so what can I say more? That's The Beatles, the greatest band of all time and this is their first album. It's obvious that it is a genius work. Songs like I Saw Her Standing There, Twist and Shout or Love Me Do never won't be old and we know that. Of course, I could say that the album recorded by one day or about their earlier concert's in Hamburg. I could say about the lack of re-recording. But every person know that. Now, after I listened to this album thousandth time, I can say that it was beginning of the road. Road, who gives us the Abbey Road, White Album, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. Road, who gives us the best sounds in music history. The Beatles were young boys in 1963. Then, they was growin' up.</span>,<span>With the excitement generated from the opening count in of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to the orgasmic closing crescendo of ""Twist and Shout"", the Beatles first album foretells of a musical landscape change brewing in Great Britain.<br><br>Whether it's the assured lead vocal from McCartney and foot stomping rock bravado beat provided by Ringo on ""I Saw Her Standing There"", or the heavenly vocal harmonies of ""There's a Place"", or even the subtle sexual charge and desperation of the ""come on, come on"" section sung by Lennon  during ""Please Please Me"", this album features a lot of range and a lot of great music.<br><br>With ""Please Please Me"" the Beatles start off solidly with an instant all time classic, ""I Saw Her Standing There"". They then cruise through some vocally competent though safely standardized covers and originals until the mid-point of the record. The album jumps back into swing with the album's title track and then follows with the bluesy yet painfully and lyrically bare ""Love Me Do"". How the Beatles are able to pull off ""Love Me Do"" and make it sound somewhat interesting is really a testament to their genius as performers.<br><br>And while a song like ""P.S. I Love You"" can sound so sweet that it's syrupy, the performance put in by the group help to legitimize what would otherwise be an exercise in hokey melodrama. I especially like the vocal exclamations that John, Paul and George give in the ""as I write this letter"" part of the song. The idea for each to do brief vocal solo's during ""P.S. I Love You"" on this first album would later germinate into the abbreviated guitar solos each of them would take on the song ""The End"" from their last album, ""Abbey Road"" six years later.<br><br>The last part of the record begins to play out much in the same way that the first part of the record played out, with a couple of cover tunes, one decent(Baby It's You) and one that should have been avoided(A Taste of Honey)at all costs. And though ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and ""There's a Place"" are not quite in the same class as some of the stronger songs on this record, they do feature great vocal performances and in the case of ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"", a catchy and quirky melody.<br><br>And for what would become a staple of nearly every Beatles album to follow, the Beatles closed their album with a song that made you want to relive the experience over again and again.<br><br>The inclusion of ""Twist and Shout"" was not only a smart choice, but for all that were concerned into the making of the record, it was THE choice, the only choice. Thank goodness Lennon was able to sing through it to deliver what is widely considered to be one of the best rock vocal performances ever. It's his vocal performance on ""Twist and Shot""  that help to make ""Please Please Me"" a legendary album, possibly a classic. But just musically, from song to song, the album is strong enough to stand on its own as an above average album. It isn't their best, but as it is their first, this is a monumental first record.</span>,<span>A Taste of Honey is really the only track I don't like. Great album.</span>,<span>A good and enjoyable debut effort from one of the biggest bands on earth. 1/2 the songs are covers, which they continue to do for several more of their albums. There's nothing too spectacular here, but it's still a good listen. My favorites here are ""I saw her standing there"", ""There's a place"" and ""Twist and Shout"". These songs are quite nostalgic for me; my dad would listen to these early Beatles records a lot while I was growing up. Good stuff.</span>,<span>I actually like a decent amount of the early stuff. Perhaps because a lot of it is not COMPLETELY overplayed.</span>,<span>Giant steps and baby steps. An uncertain mix of covers and originals, with performances both hesitant and confident, this is one of the few Beatles albums where you could reasonably deploy the ""Skip"" button on your remote.<br>The best of these tracks are timeless and part of pop history, including the terrific title track, McCartney's exuberant ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and Lennon's Herculean take on ""Twist And Shout"". A few rungs further  down are the cutesy ""Love Me Do"" and ""Misery"", the confident ""There's A Place"" and slightly gauche ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"".<br>Of the remaining covers, Lennon displays the best taste and confidently despatches  ""Baby It's You"" and Arthur Alexander's ""Anna"".<br>Some I can do without, ""Ask Me Why"" is irreparably twee, the less said about Paul's ""A Taste Of Honey"" aberration the better while I was never in favour of Ringo always getting an album track to sing anyway and ""Boys"" doesn't change that.<br>But in an era when albums by pop stars usually encompassed two hits and 12 fillers, this sometimes engaging and you could certainly say promising album, challenges the norm, something the band were to do on a regular basis in the coming years.</span>,<span>Man, was I a jackass in my original review or what? I called the Beatles a “sacred cow” and labeled this “largely homogenous and squeaky clean pop music… ultimately expendable and with relatively little replay value.” Maybe I shouldn’t be too harsh on myself, as this is a pretty common take on the boys’ 1963 debut, no doubt a backlash to the generational reverence of boomer-era rock critics. Whatever the case, a funny thing happened: despite listening to years more of both the rock canon and the Beatles own discography, these “raw and simple songs” have remained welded to my consciousness to this day. The goofy little descending piano figure in “Misery,” Lennon’s strained, tortured vocals from “Anna (Go to Him)” on, the gender-bending Ringo-led chaos of “Boys,” the little “Ohh, yeah” on the chorus of the title track — the list goes on.<br><br>You have to look at this in its proper context. Not just in terms of the Beatles’ career, which seems to be everyone’s default, but within the wider pop landscape as well. Compared to their contemporaries (e.g. the early Beach Boys, much less the still-nascent Kinks and Stones), Lennon / McCartney’s songwriting chops are remarkable. There are a lot of covers here, sure, but they’re chosen expertly, contributing to the energy on display. And ironically enough, the particular nature of this LP, recorded in one day and relying heavily on their live repertoire for material, means that it’s a more cohesive whole than even their own immediate follow-ups. Sure, some songs are below par: “P.S. I Love You” borders on the trite, and even “Love Me Do” splits me down the middle (overarching formulaic feel vs. fantastic harmonica bridge). Both of these are primarily McCartney numbers, and though he fixes his average with “I Saw Her Standing There,” I still give the edge to Lennon here; his vocals, apparently under the influence of a bad cold, are a consistent highlight.<br><br>The two undisputed standouts are the album's first and last tracks. The above-mentioned ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a nice, sunny, uptempo rocker, and one of the band's most danceable songs to boot. It may well be rock’s prototypical album opener, all teenage excitement and sexual spark. As for the closer, ""Twist and Shout"" rocks harder than just about anything else that I've heard from up until that point in rock'n'roll. Its beat has that sort of slightly-sloppy, bouncy rock feel that you can hear in songs like the Kingsmen's ""Louie Louie,"" but what really does it are Lennon's vocals — he just kills it, and the fact that he managed it in only one take just adds to the mystique. The Beatles would rapidly hone their songwriting skills in the years to come, pursuing reckless innovation and leaving most of their contemporaries in the dust, but they would never again provide the sheer kinetic punch offered by these two tracks bookending their debut.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Rating:</em> Strong 3.5 to light <strong class=""rymfmt"">4</strong>.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Highlights:</em> “I Saw Her Standing There,” “Please Please Me,” “Twist and Shout”</span>"
"<span>Pretty groundbreaking...a band that wrote its own songs.  Solid pop. A taste of honey is dissapointing.</span>,<span>I love this album more than some of The Beatles' releases that came after it!</span>,<span>So much musical greatness achieved in just ONE DAY!</span>,<span>I was born in April 1964 - in fact, it was the week that the Beatles held the top 5 spots on the Billboard singles chart.  Though I was aware of them, as a band and solo artists, throughout my childhood, I didn't really pay too much attention until the release of Elton John's cover of ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" and the rocker-compilation-related single version of ""Got To Get You Into My Life"".  I started with ""Red"" and ""Blue"" and worked my way through the others in no particular order.  Because of this, I wasn't privy to their development as artists and cultural touchstones, except in retrospect, which makes me tend to enjoy their later material.  So as I make my way through their music, my ratings will reflect their songs in terms of how I currently enjoy them, rather than how they revolutionary they sounded at the time.<br><br>Most of the material on ""Please Please Me"" was on one of the last pre-CD Beatles cassettes (!) I bought, ""The Early Beatles""  They are -<br><br>""I Saw Her Standing There"" - The best song here is also a testament to John and Paul as a songwriting team: imagine the second line as ""never been a beauty queen"" instead of John's ""you know what I mean"".  Even the high-wire energy of the performance couldn't save that corniness.  Thankfully, the tune lives up to the immortal count-in, a blast of pure adrenaline from Paul's whoops and pre-solo scream to George's primatively affective guitar work.  I actually think it fits in better with the ""With The Beatles"" material (most of which was released on these shores as ""Meet The Beatles!"") than it does here - the rest of the LP suffers in comparison.  True confession: I wrote a parody of this in Junior High called ""I Saw Her Lying There"", with the refrain ""I'll always carry a rubber"".  Ah, youth...<br><br>""Misery"" - This is one of 2 songs from “Please Please Me” that was never released on Capitol, so I had to wait until “Rarities” came out before I picked it up.  I’m probably more fond of it than I should be thanks to it being an early favorite of my son’s (as well as a joke between us).  Still, George Martin’s descending piano is fun, and John’s improvisations at the fade let us know it’s meant to be a parody (as if the opening “The world is treating me bad” didn’t give it away).<br><br>""Anna (Go To Him)"" - The performance is okay, especially John’s passionately angry vocals on the ""all of my life"" refrain, but the song is way too assembly-line-doo-wop.  I know John was a big fan of Arthur Alexander, and cited him as an influence on his songwriting, but in this instance he and the band hardly did him justice.<br><br>""Chains"" - It’s a shame The Beatles’ only cover of a Goffin-King tune isn’t more memorable.  George’s lead vocals are ill-suited for the sentuments of ""I want to tell you pretty baby/I think you're fine"", but he’s not solely to blame: the whole performance is lackluster in comparison to many of their other early covers.  <br><br>""Boys"" - Ringo manages to inject a little life into the procedings with this high-energy rocker that wisely doesn't put his limited vocal skills to the test.  John and Paul do a passable imitation of the Shirelles on the chorus, but the screams on the break are pure Fabs.  I can't hear this song without imagining Paul's breakneck introduction of it on the Hollywood Bowl LP, followed by deafening shrieks: I'd recommend seeking the LP out if you haven't heard it (I found it on CD at the last Fest For Beatles Fans I attended).<br><br>""Ask Me Why"" - The Beatles became known for having b-sides of equal or better quality than their singles.  This flip of the title cut does not in any way fall into that category.  It's probably the worst song here, though there is another contender coming up.<br><br>""Please Please Me"" - George Martin's advice to speed this up from the Roy Orbison-influenced ballad John had in mind was one of his most astute calls, and props to the band for making it a classic, the only real contender to ""I Saw Her Standing There"" for best song here.  Everything clicks, from Paul's single-note harmony vocal on the verses to George's pre-chorus guitar lick and one of Ringo's finest early performances, especially the kicks on the final ""you"".  As for the lyrics, if John wasn't singing about ""you do me and I'll do you"", he should've been.<br><br>""Love Me Do"" - I won’t argue that “Love Me Do” gave any indication of a musical revolution, or even that it’s anything more than a trifle any 4 teens with guitars and a drum kit could knock off in a half-hour.  That idea that anyone could create it is part of its charm, of course, along with the irony of hearing the band that would change the world making such an innocuous opening statement.  Besides, its simplicity doesn't sound so out-of-place considering the hit singles of our post-rock age (""I whip my hair back and forth""? Really?)<br><br>""P.S. I Love You"" - Paul isn’t quite the romantic charmer that he would soon blossom into on the B-side of “Love Me Do”, and aside from the spontaneous-sounding “you know I want me to”, the performance is uninspired.  Those harmony vocals on the verses are ugg-ly.<br><br>""Baby It's You"" - Another Shirelles cover, this time from the talented pens of Bacharach and David, and my favorite cover song here.  John, as usual, sounds completely desperate in the throes of love - his extended “wha-oe”s after each verse make this one of the better tracks here all by themselves.  With George and Paul’s accusatory “cheat, cheat” backup vocals and that moment of silence before the title phrase, this becomes almost as emotional a cry for help as, well, “Help!”.  For an alternative, equally strong version (with a hilarious intro, complete with James Mason imitation), check out “The BBC Sessions”.<br><br>""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" -At this point, George doesn’t have any compositions of his own, so John wrote one for him.  His obvious awkwardness behind the mike fits the shy-boy lyrics more effectively than either of his bandmates would, improving the quality of what would’ve been a minor addition.  I do enjoy those ""doo la la""s as well.<br><br>""A Taste Of Honey"" - I have no issue with Paul's dabbling in the kind of music his father exposed him to: I'm not one of those rock purists who disdain anything pre-Chuck Berry.  Still, this sluggish exercise is the worst cover here, from Paul's schmaltzy delivery to the uninterested participation of his bandmates.  Fortunately, he would become more comfortable with this kind of thing as time went on.<br><br>""There's A Place"" - Certainly the most cerebral song here, and the first instance of a Beatles lyric that looks inward.  The first lines would seem to be an inspiration for one of my favorite Beach Boys songs, ""In My Room"", though unlike that masterpiece, this has little going for it melodically, fine harmonies aside.  More great drum work from Ringo, though.  <br><br>""Twist And Shout"" - There's no denying the tonsil-shredding vocals of John on the LP's famous closing track, and the vocal crescendo would remain one of the band's most justifiably memorable moments.  Overall, though, I've always felt this was overrated: the arrangement lacks the drive that the song demands, and the backing vocals seem perfunctory.  Given what came before, it's a solid ending to an uneven collection, but it's nothing I ever play divorced from the rest of the LP the way I do with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" or ""Baby It's You"".<br><br>I noticed I got all the way through this without once mentioning the frequent use of John's harmonica.  Aside from ""Love Me Do"", I don't think it makes much of an impression one way or the other.  Unlike Bob Dylan or Stevie Wonder, John never really figured out a way to integrate it into the Beatles' music, with a few exceptions.</span>,<span>Listening to this album makes me wonder why is this group so amazingly appreciated. If I was a teenager in 1963, would I have been listening to Beatles? For sure I would have been playing Elvis, Chuck Berry, Eddie Cochran and the other rock'n'roll acts, but Beatles and their <em class=""rymfmt"">please, please, love, love, wou wou wouuu...</em> and that stuff. The hell I don't know.</span>,<span>Tytuł: Please Please Me<br>Wykonawca: The Beatles<br>Data wyd.: 22.03.1963<br>Wydawca: Parlophone<br>Długość: 32:45<br>Producent: George Martin<br><br>	Dawno, dawno temu, w pięknej krainie zwanej Anglią, żyło sobie czterech chłopców, którzy postanowili założyć zespół muzyczny, zainspirowani nową muzyką zza Wielkiej Wody. Mimo początkowych kłopotów w końcu im się to udało, i zespół otrzymał dwuznaczną nazwę The Beatles. Wtedy jeszcze tego nie wiedzieli, ale już wkrótce okaże się, że stworzyli jedną z najlepszych, najbardziej wpływowych grup na świecie. Oto historia, którą napisało samo życie, historia przeszywająca serce i poruszająca duszę, historia zwykłych chłopaków, którzy przez przypadek zyskali ogromną popularność. Oto historia The Beatles...<br><br>	Tak, tak, tak, ale czy ktokolwiek będzie nią zainteresowany? Czy istnieje jeszcze człowiek, który jej nie słyszał? Prawda jest taka, że wszystko co można powiedzieć o tym zespole zostało już dawno powiedziane, napisane i oprawione w ramki. Czegokolwiek by jednak nie mówić, jedna rzecz jest absolutnie pewna: Beatelsi są wielcy i basta! To czego dokonali w dziedzinie muzyki można porównać jedynie z dziełami Leonarda w zakresie malarstwa, Newtona w zakresie fizyki, Edisona w zakresie energetyki.<br>	Przenieśmy się jednak w czasy, gdy zespół ten jeszcze nawet nie śnił o takiej sławie, jaką osiągnął. W czasy gdy muzyka wyglądała zupełnie inaczej niż dzisiaj. W czasy, gdy Beatelsi mieli na koncie dopiero dwa single, które nieźle radziły sobie na listach przebojów, ale daleko im było jeszcze do najlepszych. Jednym słowem: w czasy przed nastaniem Please Please Me.<br>	Jedna, bardzo ważna rzecz, którą należy wiedzieć o tej płycie: dziesięć z czternastu utworów na niej zostało nagranych jednego dnia, podczas jednej sesji nagraniowej. Później oczywiście dostała się w ręce Georga Martina, człowieka, który był jednym z głównych architektów sukcesu Beatelsów, ale i tak ostateczna wersja zachowała tę surowość, charakterystyczną dla albumów koncertowych. W pewnym sensie jest to właśnie taki album: koncertowy, a już na pewno dałoby się go określić jako live.<br>	Okładka nie zapowiada niczego szczególnego, chociaż umieszczone na nim zdjęcie można uznać za symboliczne: Beatelsi spoglądają z uśmiechem w dół schodów, których zostało im jeszcze wiele do przejścia. Na zdjęcie nałożono proste, charakterystyczne dla tamtych czasów napisy: nazwę zespołu, tytuł, oraz informację, że płyta zawiera utwór Love Me Do i dwanaście innych piosenek. Informację fałszywą prócz Love Me Do mamy na płycie trzynaście utworów. Wygląda to okropnie, ale cóż, takie były standardy wydawania płyt we wczesnych latach sześćdziesiątych w Anglii. Standardy, które już wkrótce zmieni kto? Nie muszę odpowiadać...<br>	Jeśli chodzi o samą muzykę zawartą na albumie to przede wszystkim brzmi ona niesamowicie świeżo. Martinowi udało się uzyskać znakomity efekt: od pierwszych chwil dajemy się pochwycić przez tę muzykę, wypełnia nas ona, sprawia, że chce się nam skakać i krzyczeć. Nie wiem, czy istnieje inna płyta z tamtego okresu, która dawałaby aż takiego kopa. W dodatku, mimo całej swojej surowości, jest zagrana po prostu perfekcyjnie: każda nuta, każdy akord, każde uderzenie wydają się być tam gdzie być powinny. To jest ważne i wiele mówi o autorach tego dzieła.<br>	Co jest również genialne, to konstrukcja albumu. Dokładne przyjrzenie się liście utworów ukazuje nam geniusz Georga Martina. Musimy przy tym koniecznie pamiętać, że wówczas płyta dzieliła się na dwie części, umieszczone po dwóch stronach winyla.<br>	Zaczynamy od I Saw Her Standing There Paula. Chyba trudno sobie wyobrazić lepsze, bardziej żywiołowe otwarcie. Początkowe odliczanie „one, two, three, foah” mówi nam: „wkraczamy na scenę, zaczynamy coś nowego i od tej pory nic już nie będzie takie samo”. Potem następuje szturm na uszy: dwie minuty absolutnego szaleństwa. Konstrukcja utworu jest do bólu standardowa, ale to tylko dowód na to, że nawet z takich standardów można wycisnąć coś genialnego.<br>	Po tym żywiołowym wprowadzeniu mamy spowolnienie w postaci Misery. Niby tekst jest o cierpieniu, niby powinniśmy współczuć wykonawcy, ale w rzeczywistości po prostu nie możemy powstrzymać się od radosnego wspólnego śpiewania. Podobnie jest z Anna (Go to Him), pierwszym z sześciu coverów na albumie. Tak tak, na Please Please Me mamy covery i to w takiej ilości. Nie jest to oznaka braku inwencji, po prostu tworząc longplaya będącego przedłużeniem singli i nagrywając go w jeden dzień trzeba było sobie na to pozwolić. I mówiąc szczerze album w ogóle na tym nie traci, a nawet w jednym przypadku wiele zyskuje, o czym przekonamy się na końcu.<br>	Kolejnymi coverami są Chains i Boys, dwa utwory bardzo podobne w konstrukcji, zaśpiewane kolejno przez Georga i Ringo. Obaj członkowie zespołu nie wnieśli żadnego twórczego wkładu w powstawanie albumu, zespół miał jak na razie jednego wyraźnego muzycznego lidera w postaci Johna, któremu jednak już wtedy deptał po piętach Paul, pozostali członkowie byli zaś w cieniu. Na razie jednak nie prowadziło to do większych konfliktów. Oba kawałki to powrót początkowej energii ze zwielokrotnioną siłą. Po nich przechodzimy do najważniejszej części albumu: singli.<br>	Sposób w jaki umieszczono je tutaj to czysty geniusz: najpierw mamy singiel Please Please Me w odwróconej kolejności, tak by najważniejsza piosenka zamykała pierwszą stronę. Drugą stronę otwiera już normalnie Love Me Do. A zatem słuchacz winyla znając poprzednie hity Beatelsów musiał przebrnąć przez całą pierwszą stronę by dostać się do Please Please Me, a potem przełożyć plytę na drugą stronę, by usłyszeć kolejny wielki hit. Genialny chwyt marketingowy.<br>	Co otrzymujemy w tej czwórce? Po kolei: Ask Me Why to delikatna, liryczna ballada miłosna, bardzo spokojna i bardzo dobra, chociaż ustępująca późniejszym dziełom zespołu w tym stylu. Please Please Me to chyba najlepszy utwór na calym albumie, a na pewno jeden z najlepszych. Trudno o tym mówić, trzeba to po prostu usłyszeć: te zwrotki, te harmonie w refrenie, ten mostek, tę solówkę... Czysty geniusz, przy którym można tylko płakać z radości, co też fanki na koncertach nagminnie czyniły. Love Me Do to...<br>	Love Me Do to tragedia. To żart. To najgorszy utwór, jaki popełnili wcześni Beatelsi. To zaprzeczenie wszystkiego czym ten zespół jest: idiotyczny tekst, powtarzanie do bólu jednego motywu i kłująca w uszy harmonijka. Nigdy nie mogłem zrozumieć popularności tego kawałka, który w mojej opinii jest gorszy od najgorszych utworów disco polo. Słysząc go mam ochotę wziąć dwusieczny topór i masakrować nim ludzi. Dlaczego musieliście mi to zrobić, Beatelsi, w samym środku takiego arcydzieła? Dlaczego? Na szczęście druga strona tego singla w postaci P.S. I Love You to już przykład czystego geniuszu pana McCartneya. Utwór napisany jest w formie listu miłosnego: czegoś takiego jeszcze nie było. Ogólnie jest to wspaniała, wpadająca w ucho balladka.<br>	Kolejna część tej płyty to lekki spadek mocy. Nie zrozumcie mnie źle, każdy kolejny utwór jest na swój sposób wspaniały, ale nie mogę pozbyć się wrażenia, że po głównym daniu w postaci singli dostajemy teraz już tylko dania co prawda pierwszej świeżości, ale kucharz już nie wkładał w nie serca. Baby It's You to dosyć standardowa jak na tamte czasy piosenka o miłości, wypuszczona dwa lata wcześniej przez The Shirelles. Dlaczego Beatelsi postanowili ją scoverować, a w dodatku jeszcze wydać potem na singlu pozostaje dla mnie zagadką.<br>	Do You Know To Know a Secret jest ciekawą, chociaż nieco standardową piosenką w stylu „I love you”. Przyjemnie się jej słucha, ale niewiele wnosi. Podobnie jak cover A Taste of Honey, który w dodatku wydaje się zupełnie do tego albumu nie pasować. Jeśli natomiast chodzi o There's a Place to bardzo cenię sobie tekst tego utworu, który opowiada o specjalnym miejscu w umyśle, w które można się udać gdy jest się smutnym i samotnym. Już sam fakt, że nie słuchamy o relacjach damsko-męskich czyni tę piosenkę interesującą, a tekst, mimo że poezją jeszcze nazwać go nie można, czyni z Johna kogoś więcej niż tylko zwykłego grajka. Lata później okaże się, że było to prawdą.<br>	No i w końcu mamy to na co wszyscy czekali: Twist and Shout. Nagrane w jednym podejściu, śpiewane zachrypniętym głosem Lennona, zrobione zupełnie inaczej niż oryginał, stało się przedmiotem kultu. Ta piosenka idealnie podsumowuje tę płytę: jest energiczna, świeża, radosna, sprawia że po plecach przechodzą dreszcze z nogi same zrywają się do tańca. Kto nigdy nie słyszał charakterystycznych chórków ten nie wie czym jest rock and roll. Zakończenie, podobnie jak otwarcie, jest wręcz idealne.<br>	Podobnie jak cała płyta. No dobrze, może ma kilka wad w postaci nieprzemyślanej strony drugiej czy Love Me Do, ale ogólny obraz jest bardzo, bardzo pozytywny. I co prawda jest to album bardziej do tańczenia niż do słuchania i być może pochodzi z czasów, gdy nikomu nie śniło się jeszcze, że muzyka może coś przekazywać, ale jest zwiastunem, zapowiedzią czegoś nowego, czegoś co już wkrótce zmieni oblicze przemysłu rozrywkowego. Wystarczy wziąć dowolną płytę z tamtego okresu i porównać ją z Please Please Me. Różnica jest kolosalna. Beatelsi weszli na rynek muzyczny z hukiem i już wkrótce okaże się, że było to pęknięcie balonu w porównaniu z Hiroszimą, jaka miała potem nastąpić.</span>,<span>As I'm sure you already know, this is The Beatles first LP.  Basically a run through of their live set at the time.  The bulk of the album was recorded in a single day, so at points it can seem sloppy.  A couple of the choices for covers are questionable, and a couple of the originals are ""nothing to write home about"".  All in all I'd still say this is still a <strong class=""rymfmt"">great</strong> album, and worth picking up.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is the beginning of it all. It's the Beatles first LP release. <br><br>Some of the songs sound a bit sloppy, but that's because they recorded it in one day. You have to remember, at this point, the record company, EMI, along with producer George Martin, was taking a gamble. The group had just come off a string of badly received auditions, including their infamous Decca rejection. Ther audition even for EMI was considered mediocre at best, and Martin had expressed his decision that the band would not be signed with Pete Best on drums. In comes Ringo, who wasn't even allowed to play drums on the single ""Love Me Do."" (He got to sit in a corner and play tambourine.<br><br>True to recording fashion of the time, the album was completed from songs the band knew without hesitation, so they could be knocked off quickly; one by one. <br><br>It was originally designed to be a live album and producer George Martin wanted to record it at the Cavern Club, where the Beatles were basically the house band. While attending show at the Cavern, Martin saw the cramped, and more important, damp quarters. Because of this, he decided that it would be better off made in the studio. To give it a live feel, everyone just plugged in and played together. Some may consider it messy, but I think it gives it an excellent charm.<br><br>It's the only Beatle album to credit the songs to McCartney/Lennon instead of Lennon/McCartney. Eight of the fourteen songs are originals. The others are B-Sides and lesser known singles.<br><br>It starts out with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" with its ""1-2-3-4"" count in purposefully put there to enhance the ""live"" feel. McCartney wrote this rocker about seeing a girl and dancing with her.<br><br>There's not a ton to say about most of the songs. They're all played with the same lineup: two guitars, a bass and drums and they're all played with that early Beatles energy which was picked up during their tenures in Hamburg.<br><br>George Harrsion sings ""Chains,"" a little known single by a girl group called the Cookies. They gave him this easy song to sing because his singing voice hadn't quite developed yet.<br><br>Ringo sings a song called ""Boys,""which I never understood why people didn't question him singing it. It is about how cool it is to date a boy.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> ends with one of the Beatles' best covers, ""Twist And Shout,"" a track during which John Lennon almost ruined his voice, and took a few weeks to recover.<br><br>The record may seem light to modern listeners, but you have to remember that in the early 1960's, this record was pushing it. Most English bands were releasing slower pop songs, and when the Beatles appeared, they started a trend which was to play with a raw, carefree style. For example, the title track, which was originally meant to be performed in a Roy Orbison style, was sped up and turned into a rock song. Adding a harmonica, and fairly complex harmonies throughout the song made it a little rough for the time. That's not even mentioning the sexual meaning behind the lyrics and the subtle way they sing them. That certainly hadn't been done before.<br><br>Yes, <em class=""rymfmt"">Plese Please Me</em> is simple and sparce. Yes, it's full of covers, and no, it doesn't showcase material of the magnitude of what they would later release. That's not the point. This is early Beatle work. They started out as a rock n' roll band, and this is a rock n' roll record. I don't see how anyone could give it a low rating. It's a great album if you ask me.</span>"

If anything this here debut is one big love letter from The Beatles to their mentors, loves, and idols. The music of the first generation of rock. Even most of the original songs don't entirely have a ""Beatles"" sound to them, especially Ask Me Why which has nothing really Lennon esque about it's melody at all, sounds like a cover but isn't. But hey, all this helps the boys stand out a ton anyway. How? Because they clearly have really good taste of course! I skipped covers on these types of albums before, and on my more solid go throughs I'm giving them an ear. Am I going to rate them like I would original songs? No. But I am considering them part of things now, more as in what they add as details rather than as full songs. And as details the covers here add a sense that these dudes like good music and understand everything about it too. Twist and Shout is the definitive version of the song these days after all mostly because Lennon tears it to pieces as much as anyone in 63' could anyway. Other bands...they didn't pick songs as worthwhile as are picked here, nor did they play them with enough conviction. But of course the REAL show here, the REAL point, and what's TRULY impressive is what the fuck else? The originals. Now of course not all of them are impressive or anything, the aforementioned Ask Me Why really just sounds like a color by numbers attempt at writing a song of their past, the same way a million folks would do with The Beatles themselves down the line coincidentally. Same with PS I Love You. They aren't bad songs though (particularly the latter) it's just they aren't Beatles standards for a reason you know, and heck they barely sound like Beatles songs! They are utterly redeemed by the classics this contains, that's right, already classics on hand. I Saw Her Standing There, Love Me Do, and the title track? Please. The jig is up when those come on. Stuff like that thankfully made these guys stars beyond stars, thus enabling them to go on to work on ALBUMS. Yeah, actual albums eventually! Because this hardly feels like one. I'm not going to pretend this is some superman work just because The Beatles made it. Because outside the obvious highlights it's....pleasant and not much else. Even those songs aren't so good as to push this over to the greatness category. An excellent debut in getting one pumped for the band.<br><br>Rating: 3.5<br>Highlights: I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Twist and Shout</span>,<span>Although there is some good songs, unless you're a teenage girl who grew up with this early work by the Beatles, this probably won't appeal to you. ""Misery"" and ""A Taste of Honey"" are awful. ""Twist and Shout"" is easily the best song as John Lennon nearly ripped his vocal chords singing it.</span>,<span>Beatles in 1963. So young and so talented...  <br>...and such a great album to start with.</span>,<span>It's difficult to reconcile the early Beatles albums with their later, more celebrated, masterpieces but, significantly perhaps, the first two songs on Please Please Me introduce the voices and characters of McCartney and Lennon immediately as the life-loving optimist and the hard done-by pessimist, personas that would endure and develop throughout the course of The Beatles career.<br>McCartney seems less concerned with originality and I Saw Her Standing There, with its standard R&amp;B changes, may well have been scoffed at by an older generation of musicians but flows with such confidence, running into its ingeniously simple but effective chorus, as if it couldn't have been written any other way.<br>Lennon seems to be more interested in personal expression, he may have looked to Buddy Holly as an example, he certainly couldn't resist some of his vocal affectations, even into his solo career. Misery is the perfect counter to the opener but Lennon's remarkable voice is even better on Anna (Go To Him) and taken to the limit on Twist And Shout.<br>McCartney's penchant for romanticism is beautifully demonstrated on P.S. I Love You which is as simple as it is perfect. George gets to sing Do You Want To Know A Secret (for want of one of his own)- so he's the secretive one- and Ringo tackles the confusing lyric of Boys- which makes him one of the lads, two songs cleverly stereotyping the two remaining members of the band.<br>The title track, Please Please Me, has a killer hook with a release similar to I Saw Her Standing There. The lyric sounds like Lennon who's tendency towards sexual innuendo was second nature.<br>Love Me Do - the single version was their first ever - is surely the unlikliest of hits, a delta blues right out of the Mersey Channel and downright weird, how it must have sounded to teenagers at the time one can't imagine.<br>Probably the most prophetic song on the album is There's A Place, which is not soley about dating, Lennon's response to his insecurities is to escape into his mind, which, with the help of McCartney's musical genius was exactly where The Beatles took a whole generation of listeners during the next few years.</span>"
"<span>I really like this album. For me it makes not the top 5 or something. But it's decent.</span>,<span>I dont want to hear any shit about giving a Beatles album a low score. Im not going to kiss ass just because you're the Beatles, or Led Zeppelin, or Pink Floyd, or whomever. If your record isnt performed up to par, I'll grade as such. Before I get hate mail, at least let me explain why I dislike <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me.</em><br><br>This is the Beatles' debut album, and obviously showcases their earlier influences which include a lot of big band meets blues sound. Perhaps its a personal preference, but that style of music is just not for me. I found the harmonicas that plague this record lame and boring. The strings are plunky and redundant. The beats lack any intrigue and serve better as an audio sleep aide.<br><br>Also coming as a disappointment is Paul McCartney's singing and the lyrics he partnered wit John Lennon. The words are so very...simple! Not minimalist or unadorned...no, more like thoughtless and fitting to the fashion of the time type of simple. No spunk or soul. ""Chains"" does a fine job of exemplifying what I mean, like with the heard-a-thousand-times <em class=""rymfmt"">""I think you're fine""</em> and ""<em class=""rymfmt"">you're lips are sweet""</em> compliments. Talking about ""Boys"" should be engaging and fun, but there's no groove on the track. ""Ask Me Why"" has a calm, delicate type of charm, with words like <em class=""rymfmt"">""I should never be blue/ask me why/and i'll say I love you/and I'm always thinking of you."" </em>even with the annoying ""oohs"" in the background that make the song's tone heavy. ""P.S. I Love You"" is similar, but in the converse way: the melody is easy and pleasant, but the words are just tacky. The <em class=""rymfmt"">""sha-la-la-la-la-la-la's</em>"" and <em class=""rymfmt"">""cheat, cheat"" </em>on ""Baby its You"" are unreal. I cant take the song seriously. And oh God, ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?"" is fucking trash.<br><br>McCartney seems to have attempted to also mold his voice to the corporate taste. However, his singing is much more harmonious, melodic, and enjoyable in its natural pitch. This range comes thru a bit more on the famous ""Love Me Do"" and the superstar of the album, ""Twist and Shout.""<br><br>Which allows me to shift gears for a bit and discuss what is actually enjoyable about this record. ""Twist and Shout"" is fucking fantastic. If one were to claim listening to the guitar-swagger, Paul's sharp, raw vocals, and light ""have a good time"" content, one would be quite insane and unfit for society. I've cheered up many a bad day just by playing this track, and that sunshine is an amazing glimpse  of the Beatles' further potential and a wonderful sample of the astounding things this songs' popularity has given them the oppertunity to do. Also, ""Anna (Go to Him)"", while somber in lyrical form, has smooth guitar and smoky, obscure swoons of the name in the background, which again is an early sign of the details that make future Beatles records perfect.<br><br>But back to why this record sucks.<br><br>Apart from shitty construction, overdone harmonicas, noneffective pace, lame vocals, and cheesy lyrics, this CD is WAY too long to be 14 tracks. And the bigger thing is, I always describe the Beatles as innovative ground-breakers, as always being fresh and ahead of their time, always pushing music forward. There's none of that creativity or originality of this record. Having such high expectations, I was disappointed.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Download this:</strong> ""Anna (Go to Him)"" since you've probably already know and love ""Twist and Shout.""</span>,<span>Oto zespół The Beatles i jego pierwsza płyta studyjna. Dosyć ciekawe jest to że została ona nagrana w ciągu 9 godzin za około 400 funtów, a to wszystko po to, aby pokryć sukces dwóch pierwszych singli wypuszczonych na rynek. W ten oto sposób rozpoczęła się długa trwająca 8 lat droga do kariery i miana „Największego zespołu w Historii Muzyki”.<br><br>Here are the Beatles, and his first studio album. Quite interesting is that it was recorded over 9 hours for about 400 pounds, and that is all to cover the success of the first two singles released on the market. That way began a long road, lasted eight years of career to the title ""The greatest band in music history.""</span>,<span>There are so many types of Beatles fans out there. You have the casual listener, the critic but strong admirer kind of guy, the die hard fan and so on... To put yourself in one of these spots is hard, not for the die hard fans of course, but the rest of us might have a little trouble to define our love for the biggest rock band ever to exist. Many big words, but it's the fucking Beatles, one can not use moderate explanations. I'm finding it hard to describe my admiration for the Beatles, 'love' might be strong word, but then again 'like' is a way too light one as well. I've listened to the Beatles for as long as I can remember, but my more serious exploration of them started only a few years back. I can still remember when I bought my first Beatles CD, it was <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em>, and it happened in a rather random fashion, since my intent was not really to buy a Beatles CD that day. But I did, I had a revelation, and I instantly started a further exploration into this bands discography. <br><br>Now, countless albums, comp. albums, live albums etc. later, I'm still as fascinated as ever of this rock phenomena called the Beatles. Please Please Me was their first studio album, and as most of their early albums, it ends up in the shadow of their later masterpieces. Anyhow, this was when the big 'mania' was triggered, and all the old-timers have fond memories of this. Perhaps not everybody though, but still, it was massive. This type of massive hysteria will never happen again in music, no chance. <br><br>The album itself is good. It can't compare with the post 65' albums of course, but it's a landmark nonetheless. This was the 'bare' Beatles, no acid, no psychedelia, no trips to India, this was the original experience. But whatever direction the Beatles went in, the world followed. It was music revolution like no other, what went on in the 60's, music wise, will never be challenged, it will always stand as the most groundbreaking era in popular music. I haven't talked too much about the actual album, but that doesn't matter. It's the Beatles, everybody knows it, and most can enjoy it as well. It was a good start to a marvelous career, I could go on forever but I won't, I will let the masses do the work for me.</span>,<span>Their rise to fame makes more sense to me now that I think about it. I mean, their first few albums were very accessible, and easy to understand. Revolver wouldn't have made them superstars if that was their debut, even though it's brilliant. Young fangirls wouldn't go near Tomorrow Never Knows if they hadn't heard the sappy stuff they made in this era first, you know it's true.</span>,<span>And it was recorded in just one day...! A fantastic and promising start of what would follow in later years.</span>,<span>Please Please Me, The Beatles’ debut album, is a mixed affair which I would hardly recommend as an introduction of the band, but it is well worth hearing for any remotely big fan.<br><br>I Saw Her Standing There is a fun, catchy and absolutely charming pop number. Misery on the other hand is a dreary and sentimental ballad and not exactly a lyrical high for Lennon/McCartney. On the third through fifth song, the band displays a questionable judgment when it comes to picking covers. Anna (Go to Him), Chains and Boys are all quite forgettable, if not exactly bad. The self-written Ask Me Why and P.S. I Love You are too tame to leave any real impression as well. The title track is a sweet song that makes good use of John Lennon’s harmonica and George Harrison’s harmony vocals. Love Me Do is a well-deserved Beatles classic whereas Do You Want to Know a Secret is evidence that Harrison is a great songwriter. Finally, Twist And Shout is by far the best song of the album and features an iconic vocal performance by John Lennon.<br><br>Ultimately, Please Please Me is probably the Beatles album that feels the most outdated. Needless to say, I don’t think it quite reaches the brilliance of their later albums, even if it hints at it for sure.</span>,<span>Un premier album loin d'être anecdotique : douze chansons et presque autant de tubes dont on reconnait la moitié dès la première écoute de l'album, et dont chacun viendra vous occuper la tête pendant au moins une journée. Please Please Me, c'est du rock 'n' roll brut, frais et jouissif, accompagné des fameuses harmonies vocales des quatres Anglais, déjà excellentes. Il y a pas mal de reprises sur l'album (six), et ce sont les moins bons titres, c'est dire le génie des gusses... Enfin, ""A Taste of Honey"" et ""Twist and Shout"" sont quand même plus qu'excellentes, avec un John Lennon bien braillard sur la dernière.</span>"
"<span>In January, 1964, my dopey sister Cleo and I were watching Thaxton’s Hop on afternoon TV. At one point, the host Lloyd Thaxton was interviewing one of the guys dancing on his show. “What do you call that haircut you’re wearing?” The kid said what sounded like, “It’s a beetle haircut.” “Ewww!” said Cleo, but I thought it was cool. Within a few days L.A. radio started playing “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and I thought it was a great song. I had some vision in my mind of a rocker in a pompadour, not knowing at first what <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist"">The Beatles</a> were. Then the publicity blitz hit like a tidal wave and about all we could talk about at school was The Beatles. Before I could buy the 45 rpm single, my other sister Carmen ran out and spent her babysitting money on the monaural LP <a title=""[Album840792]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/meet-the-beatles-2/"" class=""album"">Meet The Beatles!</a>. A few days later I was at J.J. Newberry’s and saw an LP on the Vee-Jay label called <a title=""[Album797510]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/introducing-the-beatles-2/"" class=""album"">Introducing... The Beatles</a>. I thought they looked ugly and I was vaguely suspicious of the whole thing. Who ever heard of somebody putting out two albums at the same time on different labels? <br><br>Although it was years before I owned a copy of <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em>, several of my friends had copies right away and there was saturation airplay of many of the songs on the album and ""I Saw Her Standin There"" was also on <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet the Beatles</em>, which I thought was a peculiar. ""Please Please Me"" and ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" were hit songs in their own right and for my 11th birthday, Debbie Coughlin gave me the single <a title=""[Album60146]"" href=""/release/single/the_beatles/twist_and_shout___theres_a_place_f1/"" class=""album"">Twist and Shout / There's a Place</a>. By 1965, this LP was out of print and I ended up buying Capitol's condensed version, <a title=""[Album920700]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/the-early-beatles-5/"" class=""album"">The Early Beatles</a> and I think it was around 1971 I bought what appears to be a counterfeit issue of <em class=""rymfmt"">Introducing the Beatles</em>. For a counterfeit, it is a very good one.<br><br>Best songs: I Saw Her Standing There, Misery, Ask Me Why, Please Please Me, There's a Place, and Do You Want to Know a Secret.</span>,<span>Prove di Beatles. Pieno di cover impresentabili (eccetto ""Twist and Shout""), ma con i primi bagliori del miracolo (""I Saw Her Standing There"").</span>,<span>Ah...yes. The debut of the fab-four; John, Paul George, And Ringo. Here we find a band who still hasn't found their feet, but you could still tell that there was something there. Now, The tracks that are great here are fantastic and undeniable classics, but everything else...whatever.<br><br>'I Saw Her Standing There' starts the album, and does so wonderfully. It might be Paul's best early Beatles track. 'Please Please Me' is enjoyable but not very memorable, the same can be said for 'P.S. I Love You.' 'Love Me Do' is classic as classic gets, and 'Twist And Shout' closes the album, a track made their own by the Beatles and features one of the all time greatest vocal performances ever by the great John Lennon. He made his vocal chords bleed due to how hard he was singing and how many takes they did.<br><br>So is this worth owning? Well, no honestly. Every track I mentioned can be found on compilations surrounded by far better material than they are here on the groups debut.</span>,<span>Please Please Me é um disco de cultura pop óbvia, que pode não ter a importância musical nem a influência que tiveram as edições mais tardias do quarteto de Liverpool mas que é, de qualquer modo, uma autêntica revolução. <br><br>Talvez não em termos de musicalidade, mas em termos de qualidade.<br><br>Falha contudo em ser um disco coeso e acima de tudo em ser um disco que consegue entreter do início ao fim; na minha opinião seria mais desejável se durasse cerca de menos 10 minutos ou tivesse menos 2 faixas.<br><br>De todos os modos, tenho que destacar, claro, músicas que eu considero brilhantes (mesmo ao nível do resto que os Beatles fizeram):<br><br>""I Saw Her Standing There"", belíssima balada e na minha opinião a canção mais catchy deste disco de estreia.<br><br>""Do You Want To Know a Secret"", pela sua excelente secção instrumental. Simplesmente apreciem os acordes da guitarra e o quão modernos parecem...<br><br>""A Taste Of Hnoey"", canção com o título mais apropriado de todos os tempos. Autentico mel no meio deste disco.<br><br>3 estrelas e meia. Bah, são os Beatles.<br><br>PS: As versões, como tinha que ser, não prestam. Escapa a ""Anna"".</span>,<span>My love of the Beatles started rather later all things considered, or what I deem to be late.<br><br><span id=""spoiler172315""><span class=""spoiler""

style=""display:none;""> this is kind of a ramble....so I added the spoiler...I was a freshman in high school (late 92) (gulp I'm getting old), and the weekend before I heard 'em I either saw a new SNL or a rerun SNL where Dana Carvey was on doing his Paul McCartney impersonation, I don't remember the exact skit, but think it was a Hard Days Night era Beatl Paul and Carvey both being one of the funniest comedians ever (he was great--too bad the health issues cost him his run of being superfamous)....he was really making fun of Beatle Paul...<br><br>I remember being like--deep in the throws of the gen X, early gestation of my Nirvana days (had maybe 1-1.5 yrs of Nevermind listening by then), screw Paul and his sappiness.....<br><br>Then the next weekend after I saw this with my best friend, he went out and bought the White Album the very next weekend (see he wasn't really rich, but wasn't poor either, and his parents used to routinely give him $50 here or there--they had no expenses basically--something that cost him some trouble in a few years :) but we were still very young).<br><br>I was with him when he bought it and was like, why are you buying them, seeing as we both laughed at how stale Macca seemed and how perfect Carvey (or is it Karvey?)'s impersonation was the week before....<br><br>And then we played it and I was totally, unequivocally blown away...I was like, oh it's called the Beatles, this must be a Greatest Hits....and he was like, no just a regular album.  I hadn't heard a single tune on it before....and I was so excited to keep listening....and did.<br><br>Then after that fateful day, I remember reading some magazine by my then idol Kurt Cobain who was talking about his Beatles love (that's what I remembered of it) and I was really intrigued...<br><br>Well anyway, it took me a while to buy it (white album was the last Beatles album proper I bought--it's still my favorite--but in the CD era it was like $35-40 which was an absolute fortune to me since my folks never gave us any allowance or money and I had to work for the cash I got..., but shortly thereafter I started collecting my beatles albums (Magicaly Mystery Tour--first CD for me I ever bought, I had bought Nevermind on CD for my bro in Nov91--as he was getting a cd player for his birthday, and then he ran off to college, so I burned a tape of that album which I listened to like mad)....I actually remember saving up th epennies to buy these cd's....it was so novel then.<br><br>I know I bought these in this order: Magical Mystery Tour-Past Masters Vol 1-Sgt Pepper's (which seealed my love affair)--Revolver-Abbey Road....then it gets hazy, I think I had AHDN, Live at BBC and then Please Please Me (took me several years to get 'em all, and by early Sr. year I finished my beatles collection with The White Album)....</span><br><br>Anyway, this album I bought and it initially was one of those bought just to complete the series sort of buys (didn't come in thinking that, but 1-3 listens I was like this is so dated, early Beatles suck (though I always loved AHDN), and so it sat, disappointed, and wasn't listened to much even if I only had 25 cd's maybe to go through for some time.<br><br>Well in comes college, and I've since been a bit pissed at good ol Kurdt for his suicide, but jumped into Syd Barrett crazies, and in reading all I could about him, started to hear about how he went crazy for PPM of all of the Beatles albums that was the one he really played all the time...<br><br>So after not giving this a try for a while, I put it back in...and kaboom, starting to not think George's somewhat offkey, definitely out of time backup vocals on Anna (Go To HIm) were bad--that's the song that broke this album for me btw, then I began digging Misery, then and maybe all of this too is no smnall part to the fact that I LOVED Live at the BBC (on top of Syd's endorsement), but started to dig Baby It's You, and Secret....<br><br>And through the maybe, gulp 15-16 years since, PPM has been typically one of my most listened to Beatles albums, even if the doldrums of pre remastered Beatles lore of the mid to late ""naughts"", PPM was one album that made the rotation here or there, when for a good couple of years I wasn't really into the Beatles proper--though enjoyed me some Lennon and later Macca in between....<br><br>This guy's a great album....individual songs might not always be stellar (none are really bad per se, but individually none are really of the heights they'd hit later), yet there's this loose vibe, this energy engulfed in the gobs and gobs of cheese, that just makes this one really ""fun"".  It's the most fun beatles album, the chiming guitars, the small mistakes throughout, there's a light quality to this and an energy of an extremely talented band that's both trying to stick with a record label, and isn't yet as arrogant as they'd become later, to just let it all out there, and do things more for the label, then maybe for themselves, but also while doing that, still having all the tools (harmonies, guitar, tight backbeats, bass, and a maverick style) that just makes this a fun hodgepodge.<br><br>PPM is not my favorite Beatles album, probably not even top 6-7, but it's a classic, classic album and lurks in my top 100-150....even if it's flawed, silly, dated, cheesy, and well a bit immature for a band that later would be anything but.....<br><br>This is the fun album, and it's a great one if you get past the cheesy ""gloss"" all over it.  It's an album though, not as good broken apart.</span>,<span>One of the most consistent Beatles releases. ""Chains"" and ""Boys"" are the two clunkers here.<br>How in the world could it have the same rate as <a title=""[Album18]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/with-the-beatles-2/"" class=""album"">With The Beatles</a>? Get a clue, people.</span>,<span>Magic starts here. Four extraordinary talented Liverpudlians entered the EMI Studios at Abbey Road in London and when they came out, the world of popular music would never be the same. Please Please Me was a just the beginning of the journey for the band that changed the landscape and rules of music. Although, the band itself would only last a decade, the legacy they left behind is more than enough to earn them a place amongst the immortals, not only in music, but also in the history of the humankind.<br><br>Containing 14 songs, Please Please Me isn´t exactly a masterpiece like some of their later albums, but it´s simplicity and catchiness is mesmerizing. Even though only half of the songs were written by the band, songs they choose to cover blended perfectly, showcasing their influences ranging from soul, Brill Building pop, early rock and roll, skiffle, girl group sound and folk, mixed with their own merseybeat sound they mastered by playing at the Cavern and other local clubs. <br><br>Amongst the originals, ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do"" are most notable tracks, but other songs aren´t far behind, especially ""Misery"" and ""Do You Want to Know the Secret"". As far as cover goes, Arthur Alexander´s ""Anna"" is almost as good as the original and I especially enjoyed ""A Taste of Honey"", folky number wonderfully interpreted by McCartney. ""Twist and Shout"" deserves special mention, with Lennon´s vocals bringing the whole new dimension to the song that was already a classic, but Beatles made it their own, with their rock version that tops the R&amp;B versions of the original by Top Notes and Isley Brothers.<br><br>Please Please Me is not the best Beatles album by far, but it´s charme comes from being the first, revealing their roots and their best pop sensibilities, so don´t be surprised if you find it in many best of ever lists.</span>,<span>Before I really got into rock and pop music in my teenage years, and started buying albums on a regular basis, the only rock records we had in our home were a few 45"" releases by The Beatles and The Monkees (there were a few other, lesser known ones as well, names of whom I cannot remember at present).  Those Beatles ones included ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", ""Ask Me Why"" and ""P.S. I Love You"".  I knew them off by heart and, while I was certainly familiar with certain others songs they would later become famous for, THIS was really The Beatles for me (I should add ""Thank You Girl"" as another song I got to know really well on those singles).<br><br>Of course, since then, I have become a collector and listener of many different artists and genres, and that has included The Beatles' discography (only on CD for now - when I get the money, I really want to indulge in a vinyl collection), which has shown me just how much they progressed as their career went on.  Really, it's no exaggeration to say they changed the face of popular music.<br><br>So much has been written about the band and their music, either in books or, nowadays, on endless websites, that I feel lame and pretentious to go into any great dissection on their albums myself, so I won't try to reach too far.  I'll make it pretty simple.<br><br>This debut has those tracks I mentioned earlier (minus, sadly, ""Thank You Girl""), all in the middle, and they remain songs I have great affection for, and, out of them, I think I'd name ""Please Please Me"" as the best.  It has been said it was the first power pop song.  Whatever you want to call it, it is dynamic.<br><br>But there's so much more to like here as well.   ""I Saw Her Standing There"" lays their cards on the table straight away - it's the perfect opener.  ""Misery"" is a bit different, but I love the piano bit in it.  Of the other Lennon-McCartney compositions, well, they're all good.  ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"", sung by George, is very affecting, and ""There's A Place"" could have fit right in with that early single listening period I went through, even if its similarity with ""Please Please Me"" (especially thanks to the harmonica) is rather obvious.<br><br>We also have six cover versions, an amazingly small amount, considering the time period, when singing other people's songs was very much the thing.  I can't go past ""Boys"" here, with Ringo handling the vocals with surprising aplomb, but the concluding ""Twist And Shout"" shows the band could rock, and how, while ""Taste Of Honey"", a song I had already known in instrumental form via a Tijuana Brass album my parents had, is movingly soulful.  Probably just The Shirelees' ""Baby It's You"" doesn't really do a lot for me.<br><br>As we all know, all this pales in comparison with what The Beatles would produce later in the sixties.  But, as an album in its own right, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is exceptional.  It's tuneful, it's well played, it has variety.  Only the rather twee lyrics in a few of the songs offer any major drawback.  <br><br>But, as I was to eventually discover, those early listening years of mine were only the tip of a very special iceberg.</span>"

The Beatles is supposed to be the US version of their first UK album Please Please Me.  I have always thought of early Beatles as being very interesting, nowhere near as complex as their later recordings, but still just as endearing.  It stays pretty faithful to Please Please Me, but it does omit the title track, while some pressings contain ""Please Please Me"" (which are real pressings) but omit ""P.S. I Love You"" (which is on counterfeit copies) and there are also many false pressings of the album (that deal with the album cover and album label color, very confusing but interesting stuff).  Either way, it is still a very interesting release, and the songs contained are great artifacts of the early Beatles.<br><br><br>Best Songs;<br><br>""I Saw Her Standing There""<br>""Boys"" (Early Ringo that is weird, but still fun)<br>""Love Me Do""<br>""P.S. I Love You"" OR ""Please Please Me"" on the REAL pressings<br>""Do You Want to Know a Secret""<br>""There's a Place""<br>""Twist and Shout""</span>,<span>Sometimes remastering can turn things upside down. When I listened to the 1987 CD versions of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles,</em> I thought the former sounded stronger than the latter. Instead, the 2009 <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> sounded really good, and on the same year's edition of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me,</em> the raw sound quality feels slightly irrelevant. I think ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""There's a Place"" may even have become a little worse.<br><br>But still, even this album reveals why The Beatles became such giants of pop and rock. Everytime a track on the album appears to be specially good, it is a McCartney/Lennon (sic) composition; if a track isn't good, it is a cover. ""Ask Me Why"" is my favourite song on the album (beside the title track) and one of the best Beatle songs of the era.</span>,<span>Best song: I Saw Her Standing There (2)<br>Highlights: Misery, Please Please Me, Twist and Shout (+1.5)<br>Lowlights: Ask Me Why, P.S. I Love You, Do You Want to Know a Secret? (-1.5)<br><br>= 2.0</span>,<span><strong class=""rymfmt""><em class=""rymfmt"">Pleased Once Again</em></strong><br>Now that I've decided to renew my memory and to get the Beatles' albums again on listening to <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> I remembered that last time I had heard it was more than thirty five years ago. So now my years started melting away in the sound of the Beatles' debut and their songs took me back into the days of my youth.</span>"
"<span>One two three FOUR! Everyone slates the debut and most of it is highly subject to slating; but I still think it’s great. Such a tightly packed wall of moptop-shaking rock and roll that it knocks some listeners right back on their heels, and yes some of it is trite and yes they weren’t fully in their stride musically, but I dare you to try and find an album that opens and closes with such fantastically jive-inspiring bookends. Oh and the title track is good too</span>,<span>The Beatles kick start their career in a day.""I Saw Her Standing There "" gets us off to a rousing start and the closing ""Twist and Shot"" simply rips the original to shreds.In between the band give us a mixture of pop songs and ballads.It's not the choice of material that's exciting but the way they execute the material is.There is an urgency in the delivery that makes this as close as we're ever going to get to imagining what the Beatles live act at the time must have been like.Beatlemania and World Domination is just around the corner.</span>,<span>This outstanding rock n roll. The beatles began there studio career with a spark</span>,<span>There is the mainstream classic Love Me Do, and this is it. The rest is not really interesting, except that is the very first album of the most popular and legendary group until now. I guess that is why this album is overrated.</span>,<span>What an opener. <em class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</em> is easily one of those defining minutes of rock n roll history, and that intro must surely be pinpointed as one of the Beatles' most exciting moments of anticipation. What follows is a fantastic record. Even better, it being their official debut LP.<br><br>I can't even think how many different copies of this record I've had access to over the years, but I remember the first. An old C-90 of my parents from the early 80's lying around the house which had the 1st 2 1/2 albums on it (together with my dads own mini sleeve replicas hand drawn on card). I guess they were copied from a friends collection in the 70's.<br><br>A good mixture of originals/covers, and a nice example of the early Lennon/McCartney (or even McCartney/Lennon) partnership. The opener and closer are worth the admission price alone.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Mmmm (My most memorable moments):</strong><br><br>1,2,3,4!<br>Macca's bass playing throughout <em class=""rymfmt"">Chains</em>.<br>John's harmonica against that perfect open drumming (courtesy of Starkey, Best [well not this time], or White) on <em class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do.</em><br><em class=""rymfmt"">A Taste Of Honey</em> is always exciting, yet I wouldn't consider it as the albums best. However, the echo, the appregio, the main tempo and the changes in between make this a classic.<br>Everything about <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist &amp; Shout</em>, and not only for how well it's used in <a title=""[Film441]"" href=""/film/ferris_buellers_day_off/"" class=""film"">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>.</span>,<span>A lesson in how to do a debut.  I remarkable record even 50 years on.<br><br>It should be said that the Mono Remaster is the definitive version, though the Stereo has a brightness to it which is fun if you are familiar with the record.</span>,<span>Back to 1963 I was only 12 years old, no more feeling like a little boy but not yet a teenager, when ""She Loves You"" burst into my musical world mostly made of French covers of US rock'n'roll and twist hits.<br>It was a real and indelible shock and I felt something has been changing which could never stop in the future of rock music.<br><br>Looking back through the years, rating <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> 4* could appear a bit surrealistic and somewhat overrated comparing to the later Fab' Four stuff and I agree that it rather be worth 3,5*. <br>However, remember folks, that after the rock'n'roll earthquake in USA in the mid-50, The Beatles have been the most important earth tremor replica a couple of years later which also signed the death of the short Twist era. <br>Nothing couldn't be the same as before and the Liverpool boys have been on the avant-garde of rock music during the following decade.<br>That's why I rate this album 4*. Of course I won't say that I'm a big fan of songs like ""Misery"", ""Chains"", ""Boys"" or even ""Love Me Do"" and ""PS I Love You"". They are just decent correct songs but not essential ones; However ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", ""There's a Place"", ""Anna (Go to Him)"", ""A Taste of Honey"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and ""Twist and Shout"" really rock. <br>Last but not least, I heard so many terrible covers (even in French... sigh!!!) of ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and ""Twist and Shout"" that I have a tendency to embellish the Beatles versions... Weren't they already young professional artists ? <br><br>Now about this 2009 remaster, the stereo set is a must have. Among the 14 tracks here, 2 remained in original mono. Then I quote the reason why, taken from the CD booklet:<br><br>""However, because of the 1962 twin-track tapes of ""Love Me Do"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" had been discarded, the original stereo vinyl LP presented them in fake stereo. Although, this was common practice at the time, it subsequently fell out of favour and so these songs are presented in this CD in mono.""<br><br>Just above this paragraph, there is a clear explanation why the stereo take has be so simple that I quote below:<br><br>""<em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> was released at a time when mono was the preferred format and stereo records sold to a small number of HI-FI enthusiasts. The twin-track recordings formed the basis of this stereo album but their original purposes was to achieve a balance between the instruments and the vocals when creating the masters. Inevitably, the stereo mix provides an unusual experience of hearing all the voices on the right side with all the instruments coming from the left"".<br><br>Well to summarize this explanation: At that time stereo mixes were very simple and rudimentary especially in rock and pop music, which was less the case in jazz and especially classical music way more sophisticated even in the late 50s.<br><br>An highly historical album.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">""Where are we going boys?""<br>""To the top!""<br>""Where's that?""<br>""To the toppermost of the poppermost!""</em><br><br>Before fame. Before Beatlemania. Before <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Peppers</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em> there were five or so kids struggling to cope with the outlandish conditions in the Reeperbahn, Hamburgs red light district. This may not seem the time or place for a group of young musicians aiming for the big time, but it certainly toughened them to the core, as well as proving a vital period for the only recently christened The Beatles. Klaus Voorman was a regular to these wild, exciting rock 'n' roll shows The Beatles were dishing out. By the next year 1961, The Beatles had undergone a few line-up changes, but the word was out, and in their hometown of Liverpool, The Cavern was more than eager to slide the The Beatles into an evening slot. After losing Sutcliffe to a love affair in Hamburg, and booting Best out of the band for Ringo, The Beatles had discovered the winning formula. ""Love Me Do / P.S. I Love You"" was released in 1962 on October the 5th and peaked at #17 in the charts. It was the beginning of everything.<br><br>Their second singles ""Please Please Me / Ask Me Why"" flew to #1 after its release in January 1963 and The Beatles had kicked up a storm. The Beatles were now finding themselves in gruelling schedules, trying to fit concerts, radio and TV appearances, recording sessions and more importantly free time into the hectic days that lay ahead. ""From Me to You / Thank You Girl"" was recorded March the 5th and released one month later on April 11th to a warm, cozy position at #1. But, it was on this same day, April the 11th, The Beatles tripped the storm and transformed it into a hurricane. Rarely had a band as young as The Beatles kicked off a debut album with so much original material (only 6 of the 14 tracks are covers), especially one that would generate such hits and excitement. As soon as the turntable arm ran the tender needle into the grooves of the 1st sold record, The Beatles had made history. Lennon opens by singing ""1-2-3-4!"" as The Beatles sung their way into the archives of history. <br><br>While the production may not be the most convincing production of the time, and while some of the songs are simply standards (i.e. most of the cover tracks) <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is completely unique in its own right; it's a downright fun record, it has plenty of great original rock 'n' roll riffs and beats, and most importantly it's The Beatles asserting themselves as potential greats through applying their own unique twist on rock 'n' roll. While ""Boys"", ""Chains"", ""Anna"" and ""Baby It's You"" may not be the most exciting songs penned, or in particular the best songs to cover, the Beatles do add their own unique twist to the songs, whether it's instrumentally or vocally. And of course, the album has a collection of great tunes, including the rocking cover of ""Twist and Shout"", recorded in one take.<br><br>And man, to think the people of 1963 thought this was great. Wait until 1965.<br><br>6.8/10</span>"
"<span>The Beatles are the marrow of pop. Many pop mannerisms and tendencies started with them and are alive nowadays. What does that mean?<br><br>Well, that means ""Please Please Me"" is just like any good successful debut pop album: great singles (""Love Me Do"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""PS I Love You""), some good album tracks (""Boys"", ""A Taste of Honey"") and a fair share of formulaic filler. Also, they cemented Elvis Presley's habit of covering songs. Out of the fourteen tracks, six of them are covers. And in good versions, by the way - some people have a grudge with cover version that I don't really understand.<br><br>People should play more attention to The Beatles's first five albums. They are carefree pop that can be as respectable as their post-""Help!"" releases.</span>,<span>This version of the Beatles' first album is actually better in my opinion because neither Love Me Do nor P.S. I Love You were mixed in stereo, and thus appeared in fake stereo on the U.K. version of the album, and the drop in sound quality is all too apparent. This version sensibly deletes them from the song line-up.</span>,<span>This, the Beatles debut album, was not recorded by The Beatles as the world conquering mega-stars they would shortly become, it was recorded by a band who had been touring their arses off for years previous and had only one minor hit under their belt after struggling to find a label with the faith to take them on. They were given just one day in the studio (with a producer who specialised in classical and comedy recordings) to thrash out an album for a subsidiary label of a cautious EMI. What you get here is essentially a Beatles live album (albeit with the best takes used) a run through of their live set, that sounds like it was recorded light years before their next album. The playing is tight, the early Lennon / McCartney compositions a joyous pointer to things to come and the numerous covers already finely honed live. The best thing about this album is the little quirks and minor flaws, most notably Lennon stricken with a cold so you literally hear his voice 'go' as the album progresses, culminating in his giving the ravaged vocal chords one last thrash in the now legendary Twist &amp; Shout. From McCartney's 'one two three FAAAA!' at the start of 'I Saw her Standing There' to his spotaneous 'Yeah' at the end of 'Twist And Shout' this album is a testament to hard work and really only just the beginning. It does not need to be evaluated - just listened to and enjoyed. Needless to say, the following few years would see some incredible music made in that same studio and with the same producer as the Beatles (and George Martin) went from strength to strength. Criminally underrated as a Beatles album, if you are starting your Beatles journey, why not start at the beginning?</span>,<span>It is my goal to become familiar with all of the Beatles songs.  I started with this album, which is pretty darn good.</span>,<span>This is pretty good for a boy band.  The Beatles were the first major boy band and although some argue that they grew out of this around the time of Sgt. Pepper, the fact remains that the majority of their career was as a boy band.  A very good nostalgia trip for people who grew up in the early '60s, I'm sure.</span>,<span>this is the weakest of all beatles albums.<br>it has some good parts, and it has some bad parts. <br>its not bad<br><br>Best Song: I Saw Her Standing There<br><br>Worst Song: There's a Place</span>,<span>A very enjoyable album overall. I love I Saw Her Standing There and consider it one of the best openers ever. Whether it be the originals or the covers, this album delivers the goods. Is it groundbreaking? Nope. Is it a hell of a lot of fun? Yup.<br><br><br>P.S. Lennon's screaming vocal on Twist and Shout is one of my favorite vocal performances.</span>,<span>Twist and Shout is the best song on here and is without a doubt the best cover The Beatles ever did. There's nothing interesting or even memorable, except that song. Just haven't hit their stride yet.</span>"
"<span>Here's the thing, people tend to downgrade early Beatle albums (slightly unfair since the major form of pop expression was still weighted towards singles, not albums), but imagine if a CD came out today with songs as brilliant as ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", and ""Twist and Shout"". It would be proclaimed as the album of the year!! Then include the jaunty, jumpin' ""There's a Place"" with those magnificent vocals. It may not be as brilliant as later Beatle records would be, but Please Please Me is still a major work of pop and rocks out in a way that was so very fresh in 1963. And the harmonies...worth the price of admission alone.</span>,<span>I have been lent this CD by a friend, and I didn't really know what to expect when I placed the disc in the CD player. Although at the time of writing, I own all of the Beatles' albums from Help! onwards, but none from before then. Despite this, I was already familiar with six tracks from this album- I Saw Her Standing There, Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Do You Want to Know a Secret, A Taste of Honey and Twist and Shout. And to be honest, I could see why I was familiar with these and not the others, because the others are pretty awful. <br><br>Sadly, this album peaks on track one. Despite containing an awful guitar solo, I Saw Her Standing There is an outstanding song. Things fall flat from there onwards though, as much of the remainder of the first half is plain average, if that. Despite Please Please Me having a great four-bar phrase in the verses, the ""come on, come on, come on, come on, please please me, oh yeah"" is somewhat lost on me to be frank.<br><br>The Lennon/McCartney originals are, on the whole, better than the covers they use, and I don't know why they had to have so many covers on here if they had been writing for a long time up until this point. Maybe it was shitty music protocol of the time. In any case, this is hardly an album befitting 'the greatest band of all time'. It took them several years to get going and this LP is a case in point.</span>,<span>They went on to great things, but this is dull and merely proof that a band needs to fit the industry's vanilla requirements in order to gain popularity. Only then can a band of such popularity develop into something great.</span>,<span>Straight forward pop rock done amicably--so must so that they would soon get bored with playing the same old chords and reinvent music... but that's a good few years down the line. For now, Please Please Me is about dancing, singing, getting your heart broken and falling in unrequited love; all to the catchy beats and twangs of the sixties. Groovy, fun and a certified classic both for its historical significance and for its ability to sum up an entire genre in half an hour of near-perfection. No, not the best from the guys, but a sign of greatness to come for sure.</span>,<span>Temas destacados: ""I saw her standing there"", ""Boys"", ""Please please me"", ""Love me do"", ""P.S. I love you"", ""There's a place"", ""Twist and shout""</span>,<span>It is a different thing to rate Beatles albums as they are so iconic that taking into account all that they influenced, impacted, etc makes it almost impossible to subjectively rate their recordings in comparison to others. At least it's that way for me. I'm in my lower 40's and my first musical love affair was with The Beatles. They were the launching point for what has become a lifelong passion for listening to music, providing the impetus to eventually check out genres because of The Beatles dalliance in them. So, I can only rate their releases within the context of their other releases. <br><br>Saying that, 'Please Please Me' is the least essential of all the bands releases. Nothing here points to the future heights that they would scale, nothing here foreshadows that this will end up being the most recognized, revered and influential band of all time. That's not, or shouldn't be real surprising. I'm sure that most everyone knows the story of how this album came to be, why it came to be. This was recorded in 1963, before pop-rock music became a serious artform, before The Beatles themselves realized that they would help to change that. Saying that, in The Beatles canon, 'PPM' is only what it is. From here on, the band realized their potential influence, realized that there were doors to open and lead the way thru. There are some classic cuts here but as a whole, it rates no more than a 3 for me. This is The Beatles release that I listen to least but I greatly respect it, for it is the base on which all that would follow was built.</span>,<span>Pretty solid debut consisting of primarily covers (as was the nature of the day) and the killers in ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", and my absolute favorites in ""Twist And Shout"" and ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"". A classic overshadowed by what came after but still a great place to start.</span>,<span>In general, I have always enjoyed The Beatles earlier, love inspired pop tunes to their later experimental work. Their first album has its bright spots, and also a couple of places where it appears they were running out of time in the studio (apparently this was recorded in just ten hours) and had to fill the album. Of course, this is just my opinion, and this album is now 43 years old.<br><br>The Good:<br>The opening track ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is typical of my favourite Beatles tracks - upbeat, easy to sing along to, and you can swing with a partner to it. The other best known tracks on the album are in a similar vein, the title track ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"", ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" and ""Twist And Shout"".<br>I was pleasantly surprised by tracks like ""Misery and Chains"", which immediately brought back memories of the cartoon Series called ""The Beatles"", which was always on Sunday mornings on Channel 10 during my childhood. I could almost see the episodes when these songs started.<br>These tunes are still the catchy ones, the songs that grab you as they begin, and encourage you to sing along. To find I still knew all the words to these songs is indicative of their success.<br><br>The Average:<br>Probably not through any great mystery, the songs I find least accessible on the album are not written by Lennon/McCartney. ""Anna (Go To Him)"", ""A Taste Of Honey"" and ""Boys"" are not in the same class as those written by the bands major contributors.<br><br>This is, overall, a solid debut album. Half of the album is well known by most of the music listening world, a major accomplishment on any level. The signs were already there that the song writing team was quite extraordinary, and that the sharing of lead vocals, along with the backing vocals, was an inspired solution.<br><br>Rating: 3/5</span>"
"<span>Please Please Me is the first album that The Beatles recorded. Influenced heavily by rock n' roll, Please Please Me is somewhat different than what was to come following Beatlemania. Recorded using two-track machinery, the album is kept very simple, with only the piano, harmonica, tambourine and backing vocals overdubbed onto the second track. The Beatles cover six songs, and play eight songs written by themselves. John and Paul share most vocals, while George sings on two tracks, and Ringo on one. The sound quality is better than the next few albums, and the exitement and energy on the first record is something quite unique.</span>,<span>I like this a lot more than With the Beatles or Beatles for Sale, the other two records with many covers. I like the choice of covers for the most part, and the Beatles do a good job. Please Please Me and P.S. I Love You are two of my favorite Beatles songs.<br>The album was recorded in a single day too!<br><br>3.8</span>,<span>The Beatles debut album compared to most debut albums of the time is a classic. Albums were usually one or two singles with a lot of filler tacked on, but with Please Please Me it feels like The Beatles gave a bit more of a shit about what went on than usual. There is the odd duff track on here though, A Taste Of Honey is dreadful, Harrison singing on Do You Want To Know A Secret? is weak and Boys is a bit gay. But its well worth getting with classics such as the title track, Twist And Shout and I Saw Her Standing There. The start of the most important band in the world, ever.</span>,<span>It's amazing to think how The Beatles matured during the year, and may actually have reached the highes point of the ir musical supremacy on the day that they decided to split up. This just makes them musical legends even more rightly so.<br><br>This album is not the kind of unforgettable album that you would expect the beatles to have begun their career with. It did, on the other hand, chronoligically begin with one of their best song, as the first song on their first album is ""I Saw Her Standing There"", and that really is a great rock and roller, in fact one of their best of their career as a whole, and certainly one of the best five from their early days. Just as legendary is the beginning of Side B, with ""Please please Me"", that would have beed a better choice possibly than Love Me Do as the first ever Beatles song to be released, as it even looks like the better version, Lennon using the Harmonica is an excellent way, and the Please Please Me refrain remaining in history forever. These are the best songs of the album, which has its ups and downs. Chains and Boys are brilliant, as is Do You Want To Know a Secret, that comes across as a nice surprise, as we had just heard Baby It's You, which ain't so good, and neither is the one that comes after that, A Taste of Honey, which clearly doesn't fit, and slows doen the life of the album to an annoying point.<br><br>The Twist and Shout ending is hardly so legendary as it is considered to be. It's a great song for any band to play live, even the worse bands after a horrible set list could upper their standards and the evaluations of just about any audience by ending the set with ""Twist and Shout"", but I have never really been a fan of the Beatles version as much as the Isley Brothers version. This album is still great to have, as it contains some great songs, also a good few album fillers that make the album a little less special than what you would expect it to be.<br><br>PLEASE PLEASE ME - Still one of the most energetic albums ever made, and one that certainly had a revolutionsing impact on the product which rock and roll bands would have to deliver in LP format from there on. Occasionally, you feel that it's rushed and some of it not as remarkable, but the unit is tight and the rock and roll is raw, and the legend was only beginning.<br><br>KEY TRACKS - I Saw Her Standing There, Anna (Go To Him), Boys, Please Please Me.<br><br>ALBUM COVER - It's actually a pretty interesting play on perspective. With time, every Beatles album cover has become something of a pop culture symbol, and inspired many other reproductions, including a pose of the band in the same place for an Anthology album.</span>,<span>The Beatles at their lightest - heck, the album seems to be floating five inches above ground all the time.</span>,<span>There are exceptions to both of these rules, but here they are:<br>The Lennon/McCartney stuff here is amazingly catchy pop fluff.<br>The cover versions aren't as good or as compelling as the originals, unless they were used in <em class=""rymfmt"">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</em>.<br><br>On my iTunes:<br>""Please Please Me""<br>""Love Me Do""<br>""P.S. I Love You""<br>""Do You Want To Know A Secret""<br>""Twist And Shout""</span>,<span>This is the American Vee-Jay label's release of ""Please Please Me"". They knocked off the title track, which is why the name was change, and ""Ask Me Why"" (which was one of the stronger songs on there). Thus began the long tradition of American releases of Beatles albums being inferior to the originals. The whole process was a long soap opera and it turned out Vee-Jay didn't even have the rights to some of the songs on the album. At one point Brian had sold different rights to different Beatles songs to multiple American labels. This caused Vee-Jay to get into some trouble later on. This was also the most counterfeited Beatles album of all time. Lots of outlaw stuff for such an American knockoff release eh? The release date is wildly disputed due to an ad contained within some releases of the album. Even some books by Beatles scholars get it wrong. Although it was intended for a 1963 release, it didn't see release until 1964, which was one of the biggest release years for the Beatles.</span>,<span>Definitely a little bit of a rush job of a debut, I mean, it didn't take them long at all to record and they basically just played their live set right there in the studio. Yeah, this one has it's gems like ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Anna"", ""Ask Me Why"", ""Please Please Me"", ""PS I Love You"", ""Baby It's You"", ""There's A Place"" and ""Twist and Shout"" but the rest is far from great. Still, the album has it's place and has the distinction of having a much different feel from what they'd be doing a year from this.</span>"
"<span>This was surely a bit of a breath of fresh air back in '63, and nearly half a century later it's still surprisingly supple. The problem is that their future progression was so incredible that it overshadows this album's worth. A lesser problem is the heavy amount of covers in the face of the original compositions that really shine brightly. Now, having heard this album regularly for most of my life, I'll admit I'm slightly fatigued by things like ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" and ""A Taste Of Honey"". On the other hand, I never get tired of hearing ""There's A Place"" or the cool chords in the title track. The story behind the making of the album does enhance the listening experience a bit, but that's a negligible slice of trivia really. And regardless of critical and professional opinion, the original stereo mix of this album is my preferred version. It's no Revolver, but it's a fine foundation stone.</span>,<span>Opens with a classic and closes with a classic with two more right in the middle plus the personal favorites of mine ""Misery"" and ""There's A Place""</span>,<span>A record that speaks this well to the giddy rush of hormones that makes up everybody's high school years seems all good and fine until you look back and realize that your high school years really weren't all they were cracked up to be.<br><br>In other words, I'm really glad the Beatles grew out of this phase. ""Love Me Do,"" ""Please Please Me,"" the ""Twist and Shout"" cover, and a few others are still damn good tunes, but this is by far the weakest record the group ever made. No contest.<br><br>Track picks: ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Twist and Shout""</span>,<span>I really enjoy listening to this album. In all the Beatles albums and songs are all very good, no complaints here. I love all the songs on this album, they are all good in their own unique way. This is a definate must buy for all Beatles fans and for all rock and roll fans. For those that don't currently own anything by The Beatles, they should start from the beginning and make this first Beatles album their first!</span>,<span>I can do without most of the covers on here, but understandable as this album was recorded in just one day I believe. There are a few great moments elsewhere though.<br><br>""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a brilliant rock and roll song, and was a hint of the genius to come. ""Boys"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and ""Love Me Do"" are slight, but pretty fun, numbers.<br><br>""Please Please Me"" and ""There's a Place"" are classics with an emotional feel to them. ""Twist and Shout"" is the famous closer and still sounds timeless, from the harmonies to Lennon's shouting.</span>,<span>I was about to give this a 4, but no way is it as good as Abbey Road. Even though Abbey is way overrated. Anyway, this album is catchy, but oh so sappy. EVERY SINGLE SONG is about the singer and some girl! All of them! They all have good melodies, but sometimes the backing vocals give me pain. And some songs are catchy, but some are the wrong kind of catchy (listen to A Taste of Honey (who the hell put that one on the album anyway?)), but for the most part it's a good album. It's the Pablo Honey of the 60's: only get this and their second one if you want to complete the discography. Still, pretty damn good for 1963.</span>,<span>The Beatles debut LP. Legend tells of the speedy time in which this was recoding concluding with a very tired John Lennon struggling with his hoarse voice on ""Twist and Shout"". This was done in the days when albums were afterthoughts and singles were the the main focus of the music industry (something which mp3's seems to be reviving). Still even with that in mind it does have the staples of what rock albums would later do. We have the strong opening ONE TWO THREE FOOOOUR for ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and the spectacular album closing track ""Twist and Shout"". Remember, this was during the days when albums were stapled together in whatever order. The songs on here are pretty much what their Cavern setlist was around that period. As a result we get a good amount of covers, something that would decrease over time as the Lennon/McCartney (credited on this album as McCartney/Lennon) songwriting duo grew stronger. This shows that the Beatles were a good cover band. John's vocals on ""Anna (Go To Him)"" are chilling and powerful. ""Twist and Shout"" is a great example of when a cover version outshines the original. To this day it is one of my favorite Beatle tracks. Don't expect the brilliant poetry of ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" or ""The Long And Winding Road"" on here. Lennon/McCartney, while strong songwriters, were still fairly basic on here. ""P.S. I Love You"" was never a favorite of mine, and while ""Love Me Do"" is an important song historically for them, it's almost nothing when you strip it down to it's lyrics. Interestingly enough, the ""Love Me Do"" featured on here is different than the one which was issued as a single prior to the albums release. The version on here is the one with Andy White doing drums, while Ringo plays tambourine to be appeased. The cover itself is quite famous and was later reproduced in a ""6 years later"" fashion for the ""Get Back"" (to become ""Let It Be"") album, but wasn't used until the the 70's for the Blue Album. Despite the shortcomings, which was largely due to the band still growing as musicians and the time period, this is still a great album and probably my favorite of all of the Beatles early stuff.</span>,<span>One of the greatest opening albums ever, please please me started the career of the best rock band ever and solidified rock's place in American Culture.</span>"
"<span>One of the most counterfeited vinyl albums in the world!</span>,<span>It was unusal for artists to release more than a few original songs on their debut album back in '63, but The Beatles did that.  Although it certainly isn't my favorite, it was the album that started the eight-year long legacy of the Fab Four.  Not bad, except for track nine.  Ugh.<br><br>1 **I Saw Her Standing There**|3.75/5<br>2 **Misery**|4/5<br>3 Anna|2.5/5<br>4 Chains|3.75/5<br>5 Boys|3/5<br>6 Ask Me Why|3.5/5<br>7 **Please Please Me**|4.5/5<br>8 **Love Me Do**|3.75/5<br>9 P.S.

Con este comenzó mi fanatismo Beatle, snif.</span>,<span>Fact Sheet:<br><br>- Recorded in 9 hours and 45 minutes.<br>- Originally George Martin wanted to record them at a live session in the Cavern, but time was against them. Also the Cavern was a dreadful place to record. <br>- John Lennon had a bad cold on the day of recording. This explains the edge to his voice throughout the album. Singing ""Twist and Shout"" had to be done last because his voice was ripped to shreds by then and that song was gonna finish it off completely. ""Twist and Shout"" was recorded in 1 take.<br>- The original vinyl stereo-version and the original vinyl Parlophone black and gold label version are highly valuable.<br>- Contains 8 Lennon/McCartney originals and 6 covers.<br>- Ranked #39 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.<br>- In Britain the album stayed #1 for 30 weeks until it was knocked from the top spot by their next album ""With the Beatles"".</span>,<span>I was going to write a review talking about how bad this album was, being jam-packed full of pointless covers, but I ending up realizing that all the non-cover tracks are real gems.  That says something for the talent of John and Paul, seeing as they're already writing songs better than the ones that influenced them.  The album starts off with ""I Saw Her Standing There"", which I'm sure everyone agrees is a Beatles classic which was confusingly never a single.  And speaking of confusing decisions, why were two great Beatles originals, ""Misery"" and ""There's a Place"", removed from The Early Beatles instead of two of the covers?  I really don't know, because most of the covers on here are bad: not so much Anna, but Chains and Boys are boring and sound very dated.  But after that, another three originals, and guess what, they're all great.  The album kind of goes downhill after that, but hey, that's why they call it a B-side.  I do like ""There's a Place"", though, and even though I give the covers a lot of criticism, ""Twist and Shout"" is probably the best version of the song out there (including the original).  So overall, even though the group hadn't really developed their sound at this point, this album (or the non-cover tracks, at least) is a foreshadowing of their later, better material.</span>,<span>Edited on 12.02.2016 (rating changed from 2.5* to 4*, reviewed).<br><br>Holy crap! How could I give this 2.5*?! <em class=""rymfmt"">Please, please me</em> not only contains some of the Fab Four's classics, but the rest of tracks are at least solid as well. I think it's their best release, from the rock 'n' roll era.</span>,<span>Forgetting the historic significance of this release; I can only give it a 3.5.  Takeout the blistering cover of Twist &amp; Shout and the original tunes and what remains is filler (I mean it was recorded in 30 hours so that can be expected).</span>"
"<span>The first and last tracks are ones for the ages (""I Saw Her Standing There"" and the ""Twist and Shout"" cover), and ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do"" are okay.  Everything else ranges from below average to outright annoying.</span>,<span>Their most fun album, and for that reason alone it might be my favourite. The songs are less polished, their playing less adept, and the songwriting is fairly samey and derivative; but there's a whole bunch more energy, and a feeling of spontaneity which is a factor that slowly declines from here onwards in their catalogue. I've found that over time with a lot of the big-name 60s bands (<a title=""[Artist58]"" href=""/artist/the-who-1"" class=""artist"">The Who</a>, <a title=""[Artist946]"" href=""/artist/the-kinks"" class=""artist"">The Kinks</a> &amp; <a title=""[Artist45]"" href=""/artist/the_rolling_stones"" class=""artist"">The Rolling Stones</a> come to mind) I've gravitated towards their earlier, less mature but more passionate recordings. So I suppose that for a good time, this is usually my Beatles pick.</span>,<span>The covers are less than worthless.  The only good purpose they could possibly serve is to introduce a great soul singer like Arthur Alexander to a young Beatles fan.  I spoke too soon though, Twist and Shout is a wonderful cover.  In fact it's really just a Beatles song, since nobody has ever recorded a more definitive version.  <br><br>But really it seems as though the band was only trying on the first and last songs of each side.  I Saw Her Standing There is a great way to introduce yourselves to the world, then Please Please Me is just classic pop music.  Love Me Do and Twist and Shout are the only two other songs worthy of even mentioning. <br><br>It's hard to hate the Beatles for the stupid R&amp;B covers because that's just how the music industry was in '63 and if they would've tried to make a whole debut of originals they would've been kicked out of the studio without a second thought.  But it's rather easy to hate this release for the stupid covers.  The other Beatles originals are alright but they were not ready to make a legitimate LP at this point in their career.  Half a star for every good song on the album.</span>,<span>Pretty much what you'd expect if you've heard the pure pop stylings of the Beatles early days. A couple mega hits ('Love Me Do', and the cover everyone who knows nothing about music thinks they wrote 'Twist and Shout'). They made some good choices in what to cover and began to play around with their own sound - a sound that would take a few more years to fully develop.<br><br>You could easily skip this one, but the entire thing is extremely enjoyable so it may be worth a listen for this reason alone.</span>,<span>bubble gum pop at its finest.</span>,<span>Why are there 4000 issues of this? Anyway...<br><br>A good debut, nowhere near great, but good nonetheless. As was the case with a lot of early 60s albums, half of the tracks are covers. Some pretty nice covers and some interesting originals. But, as an album, or as a debut, leaves a lot to be desired.<br><br>Extra 1/2 star for the nostalgic value it holds for me. Here's my childhood y'all!</span>,<span>An astonishing debut. Not their best album, but the best of anything that had been released before. That counts for something. Plus, many classic songs here. I think this has been rated lower than other Beatles albums because it pales in comparison to Revolver and the other late 1960's classics. But look at the context: if any other band in 1963 issued an album like this, you'd give it 10 stars, right?</span>,<span>I love finding the roots of things, the beginnings. Like words; finding out why something's spelled the way it's spelled, or in culture; why people act a certain way or do a certain thing. When it comes to music, and I come to an artist's first album--no matter if its the first time I've heard the band or not--I get a teensy bit excited. What can you see birthing here that you love on later albums? What can you see dying here that the band decided didn't work? With the Beatles (pun unintended), it's boldly apparent. <br><br>While sitting down to play some guitar with this guy once, he started to play ""Please Please Me."" I didn't know it on guitar, but figured it would be easy enough to guess. You know, it's early Beatles stuff, it came out before ""music was revolutionized,"" so I can just laze about and throw out E and A chords and they'll probably fit. Oh no, oh no no no. It had me constantly watching the dude's fingers for changes, and had me worrying I was going to embarrass my self as a Beatles fan by fucking it up. And I realized: the Beatles had their shit together from the beginning! Their music was fresh, sure, everybody knew that back then, but it was also naturally innovative. <br><br>You see that in all their originals on this album, whether they're good songs or not. Even the rock'n'rolling ""I Saw Her Standing There"" has its moments of burgeoning genius. Granted, not all of their originals are hot enough to throw on your Beatles Best Of playlists. ""Ask Me Why"" has a mood about it like it was written to be on a nationwide television bandstand spotlight thing. As the little ballad in between radio hits. While everything mathematically works out musically, it sound a bit forced. ""P.S. I Love You"" is another bit of a drag, with its similar bossa nova feel that leaves you reaching for the skip button. ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" is a delightful kind of lame; it's a Lennon/McCartney song that features George on an adorable, head bobby love song that you might get stuck in your head. Other than these three--which are still good, mind you, just relics of the ruins that didn't get to the museum--the originals are fantastic tunes. ""Love Me Do,"" the more I listen to its simplistic nature, is possibly my favorite on the album. The thumpy drums, the harmonica, the signature early-Beatles harmonies... perfectly badass.<br><br>The downside to this album is the almost-half that are covers. I didn't pick it up while reading or watching anything on the Beatles, so I don't know if it's true, but most of these songs sound like the record company saying, ""You should cover these, boys, it's what the kids like!"" Because if you listen to the covers on this album, and then listen to old archive recordings of what they played when they were a poor Liverpool band in Germany following some Sheridan guy around, it's a bit different. ""Anna"" and ""Baby It's You"" are mindless pop hits, ""A Taste of Honey"" is the lamest piece of shit I've ever heard, and ""Chains"" and ""Boys"" would have been decent in other settings. I still can't conceive a notion as to why they would do ""Boys."" Weren't there other songs? <br><br>There were. <br><br>There was ""Twist and Shout.""<br><br>""Twist and Shout"" is, by fucking <em class=""rymfmt"">far</em>, the best cover that the Beatles ever recorded. They reinvented it. They infused it with their youthful, innovative energy and turned into a song of their own: one they opened their shows with, one they closed their shows with, one they rocked out to hundreds of times, one you hear nowadays more than the original recording artist (whoever it was). It's an ""oldie"" that I heartily love, and there aren't many out there. It's the only one I kept on my iPod when I went through deleting the songs the Beatles covered. <br><br>Definitely in the formative years, but also definitely one for discographic historians.</span>"
"<span>The Beatles at their lightest - heck, the album seems to be floating five inches above ground all the time.<br><br>In the Beginning there was the Word, and the Word was...<br><br>...oh wait a minute. In the beginning the Fab Four were still unaware that they were Fab (or soon would be Fab, for that matter), and thus, a certain shy, not too self assured feel about this album. In the Liverpool caverns and Hamburg strip bars, they were ferocious rockers; for their debut sessions, certainly not without the soothing influence of George Martin, they truly let rip only once - on the album closer, the cover of the Isley Brothers' 'Twist And Shout', a certain classic that has long since overshadowed the original (a pretty rare case for the Beatles - most of the time, they preferred making legends out of self-penned material). Everybody is supposed to know the story about John Lennon's ruining his voice while recording it (Arthur Janow, where were you in 1963?), and indeed, few white singers would dare to match that kind of passion and aggressiveness in early '63. But passion or no passion, the boys can't allow themselves to forget about the melodic backbone of the song either (the main riff is the most ""well-hummable"" thing on the entire record), nor can they disregard the clever structure of the harmonizing. It ain't exactly theirs, but they do it full justice, not to mention the vocal crescendos would give Paul and George a not-to-be-missed opportunity to bring large numbers of little girls to premature pubescence by vibrating their hairmops while doing it live.<br><br>However, just as 'Twist And Shout' bookmarks the end of the record, another terrific rocker bookmarks its opening, meaning that, despite having most of the songs recorded in a hurry, the guys did care a lot about careful song sequencing: go in with a bang to captivate the listener, go out with a bang to let the listener know they're going just as strong towards the end of all things. 'I Saw Her Standing There' would later become a stage favourite, and Paul is still doing it live to this very day, but if you ask me, the song could never be done full justice onstage because the greatest thing about it is the 'one two three FOUR!' countdown and the way the 'FOUR!' seamlessly flows into the upbeat, energizing guitar chords. It's still a fluffy pop song, essentially, as evidenced by the (relatively) innocent lyrics (""and I held her hand in mine"" sure can be read as a latent allegory, but I honestly don't think Paul had any secret innuendo going on here) and the vocal harmonies in the bridge section, but hey! speed it up, sharpen it up, get George to play some Berry-licks in the solo, and all of a sudden, the nice clean lads aren't necessarily as ""clean"" as you'd want to think. And, for the record, that ""WAAAAAH!"" moment when they launch into the solo, with John and Paul both screaming their heads off, Ringo shakin' up the dust, and George playing the first garage chords - that moment was never to be repeated. That's true primal rock'n'roll excitement, right from the dancefloors of Hamburg out there. Dirty and dangerous. Never to be revisited. Catch it while it's hot!<br><br>Still, that's just the gatefold. The other twelve songs are a rather natural phenomenon of their time, pure shiny pop for the likin' of the middle class, much in the manner of Roy Orbison, Cliff Richard and company, albeit already peppered with a bit of the hard-to-define Beatle spirit. Hard as it is to define, though, it's the true pepperoni of this here pizza. Yes, there's the title track, of course, which started life as a slow Orbison-like ballad and then got highwired like 'I Saw Her Standing There' and also profited highly from it - although 'Please Please Me' contains no true aggression; exultation and exuberation are my preferred words of choice here. And since it's so loud and proud and jubilant and guitar-happy, I guess in a certain sense you could call this song the first ""power pop"" number ever - at the least, you probably wouldn't get away without making an honourary mention of it in your history of this elusive genre. There's their very first, and their only not so commercially successful, single, 'Love Me Do', arguably the world's most straightforwardly repetitive song before the Ramones' debut, resplendent in its lumpy idiocy. There's the Harrison-sung, but Lennon-composed, 'Do You Want To Know A Secret', also repetitive, but this time also distinguished by cool-as-hell descending guitar lines that make you feel like you're climbing down a set of stairs for two and a half minutes, juxtaposing a brilliant refrain with an amusingly horrible bridge that contains probably the worst lyrical line ever written by a non-Ringo Beatle: 'I've known the secret for a week or two/Nobody knows but we two'.<br><br>Actually, it's been often noted at this point John still wasn't much of a songwriter - not only did he become engaged in that business regularly at a later date than Paul, he probably lacked the self-discipline of the latter as well, and wasn't so quick about learning his stuff. We'll see him pick up on it quickly over the next few albums, out of acute jealousy, no doubt, but here, songs like 'Ask Me Why' are, without a doubt, among the weakest compositions credited to the Beatles' name - although even 'Ask Me Why' is quite memorable and not without a humble charm of its own (listen to John bumbling his way through the 'I, I, I, I, I' sequence and try hiding that smile off your face!). He then redeems himself with the lyrically introspective 'There's A Place', the first Beatles song to address something different from the classic stereotypes, but I must confess that I've never been attracted to that song because of its melody all that much either.<br><br>To recompensate, why don't we sing a little song of praise to the great hidden gem on the first side - the pseudo-tragic love ballad 'Misery'? Better than anything else, I guess, it illustrates the simple and effective power of ""the average Beatles pop hook"", here represented by the inner rhyming in the verses ('I've lost her now for sure, I won't see her no more') and the way these verses, tragic and depressive by themselves, are transformed into almost a mockery of depression through John and Paul's doubletracked chanting. To be sure - in 1963, arguably the happiest year in the Beatles' lives, the year when they finally got pulled out of the world of risk, danger, and deprivations but hadn't yet overdosed on fortune, fame, money, and pussy, it'd be pretty hard to imagine them recording something like 'Help!' or 'I'm A Loser'. So if you happened to have just lost your girlfriend, my advice is - put on 'Misery' rather than any select Nick Cave album.<br><br>Despite all the burgeoning songwriting, at this point (and up to Beatles For Sale) the amount of covers is still huge: while the boys always stuck to the 'number of covers shouldn't exceed the number of originals' golden rule, they weren't as of yet consistent and productive enough to strictly limit themselves to self-penned material. Fortunately, they usually either select material that was fine and ""unruinable"" to begin with, or beatlify subpar material so that it fits in well with the originals. Arthur Alexander's 'Anna (Go With Him)' totally gets by on the strength of John's theatrical vocal performance (gotta love the contrast between the quiet verses and the totally self-destructive bridge); George does a fine work on the hilarious oh-so-Carole-Kingish 'Chains'; and Ringo gets his first vocal treat on 'Boys', a somewhat weird choice that couldn't help but transform Ringo into an unlikely idol for the ""non-traditionally sexually oriented"" admirers of the band, and all this just because they were probably too lazy to invert the lyrics that sounded totally natural out of the mouths of the Shirelles!<br><br>(Side note: unlike so many Ringo haters, I actually do like his voice: I totally disagree with the weird idea that the man could not sing. He didn't sing much - drummers aren't supposed to, unless somebody wants to bring up Don Henley - and when singing live, quite obviously experienced even more difficulties about it than his guitar-playing colleagues; but in the studio, he never really sang out of key (certainly Paul wouldn't allow him to), and there's a certain innocent ""rusticness"" to his approach that makes him contrast in quite a hilarious and endearing way.)<br><br>Anyway: Please Please Me is often called the worst Beatles album (Beatles For Sale is, I think, the only album that frequently gets an even lower reputation), but this approach only makes sense if you compare it to what would come soon, and comparing it to what would come soon doesn't make sense because, pretty much like every other Beatles album, Please Please Me is a perfect reflection of the highest musical values of its epoch, an epoch in which pop music was as much capable of producing a Sgt Pepper as Jesus Christ was capable of thinking up the Mountain Sermon at the age of three. In 1963, pop music was there to please the average Joe and to relieve him rather than burden him - and what can be more relieving than the sight of four smiling, seemingly carefree, worry-less guys on top a balcony? (Amusingly, Ringo is shot in such a way that he actually seems bigger than everybody else, with Paul being the 'smallest' - no other photo of the band I know could let the good old drummer boy vent his 'inferiority complex' so successfully!)<br><br>A more serious critique, and one that is mostly responsible for my rating this notably lower than the ""Beatles average greatest"", is that this album can be, more than anything else, divided into the ""highlights"" and ""lowlights"" parts - with a couple oddly selected covers and a couple poorly written Lennon originals not quite establishing the proverbial ""plank of immaculacy"". But I'd much rather, of course, take a constantly growing and expanding band like the Beatles over numerous bands that come into the studio fully realized, blow their wad on the first album and then make the rest of their career a gradual descent into blandness and irrelevancy. And no, I'm not naming names!<br><br><br>Track picks:<br>I Saw You Standing There<br>Misery<br>Please Please Me<br>Twist and Shout</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> was the Beatles first album, released in 1963.  As far as debut albums go, it's not a bad effort, although it doesn't have the brilliance of their later work.  The entire album was recorded in one day as producer George Martin was hoping to capture the spontaneous feel of one of their live Cavern Club concerts.  Six of the fourteen tracks are cover versions - John Lennon and Paul McCartney were just beginning to develop their songwriting skills.  <br><br>""I Saw Her Standing There"" with the famous ""one, two, three, FOUR"" count-in is one of the strongest opening tracks on any Beatles album.  An original Lennon/McCartney song (though written mainly by Paul) it's a lively, energetic rock 'n' roll inspired number.  The second track ""Misery"" is one of my personal favourites - apparently it was originally written for Helen Shapiro but was turned down as unsuitable by her manager.   Next we have the first of the cover versions, Arthur Alexander's ""Anna (Go To Him)"" featuring a great lead vocal from John. The original version is excellent too, by the way!  <br><br>""Chains"" was written by Goffin and King; this is a decent cover sung by George Harrison, but nothing special.  The third cover ""Boys"" gives Ringo a chance to sing and is another lively performance.  Lennon's ""Ask Me Why"" had been part of their live repertoire for a while - it's a nice song but I've always found it slightly boring.  The following two tracks are the two singles - ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do"".  Both are catchy, memorable songs featuring John's harmonica playing.  The B-side of ""Love Me Do"" was ""P.S. I Love You"", a simple but charming little ballad written by Paul. <br><br>Originally a hit for The Shirelles, ""Baby It's You"" is a highlight of the album, with another passionate vocal from John.  Next, George gets to take the lead vocal again on ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" - his strong Liverpudlian accent adds some charm to the song.  ""A Taste Of Honey"", another cover version, is okay, but a bit too corny!  With ""There's A Place"" John provides some of the best lyrics on the album - ""there's a place where I can go, when I feel low, when I feel blue; And it's my mind...""  Finally, the album draws to a close with another classic - ""Twist and Shout"".  One of John's best ever vocals, loads of energy, and a beat that makes you want to get up and dance.<br><br>Overall, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is not one of the greatest Beatles albums, but still enjoyable and well worth listening to. <br><br>Rating: 4/5<br>Highlights: I Saw Her Standing There, Misery, Please Please Me, Baby It's You, Twist and Shout</span>,<span>Über diese Scheibe wurde bereits millionenfach alles geschrieben, analysiert und dokumentiert.

Ohne Worte - diese Scheibe darf in keiner Sammlung fehlen.<br><br>Songtrivias:<br><br>A1 ""I Saw Her Standing There""<br><br>John Lennon und Paul McCartney begannen mit der Arbeit an diesem Song im Wohnzimmer der McCartney's. Paul schrieb einen Großteil des Songs im September 1962. [Zitat]: Paul McCartney in Observer Music Monthly October 2007 on the early days of his songwriting partnership with John Lennon: ""I mean those early days were really cool, just sussing each other out, and realizing that we were good. You just realize from what he was feeding back. Often it was your song or his song, it didn't always just start from nothing. Someone would always have a little germ of an idea. So I'd start off with [singing] 'She was just 17, she'd never been a beauty queen' and he'd be like, 'Oh no, that's useless' and 'You're right, that's bad, we've got to change that.' Then changing it into a really cool line: 'You know what I mean.' 'Yeah, that works.'"" [Zitat Ende] ""The Beatles"" spielten diesen Song zwischen 1961 und 1963 regelmäßig im Cavern Club. Beeindruckt durch die überwältigende Reaktion des Publikums beschloss George Martin, die Band einfach die Stücke ihrer Life-Performances aufnehmen zu lassen. so kommt Pauls ""1, 2, 3, 4"" auf die Aufnahme. Der Teil entstammt dem neunten Take und wurde nachträglich hinzugeschnitten. Ursprünglich sollte das Stück ""Seventeen"" heißen. Für das Album wurde es dann umbenannt. Die Basslinie wurde vom Chuck Berry Hit  ""I'm Talking About You"" übernommen. This was the last song John Lennon performed for a paid audience. He played it at Madison Square Garden on November 28, 1974 when he took the stage at an Elton John concert. Elton released this version as the B-side of ""Philadelphia Freedom"" the following year. This was the only live duet ever recorded between Elton John and John Lennon, who were good friends. Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman sang this song during a very powerful scene in the 1988 Oscar-winning film Rain Man. The Who, Daniel Johnston, Santo &amp; Johnny, and The Tubes all covered this song. With Dave Grohl playing drums, Paul McCartney played this at the Grammy Awards in 2009. <br><br>A2 ""Misery""<br><br>John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this for Helen Shapiro, a 16 year old who toured with The Beatles in 1963. Her management rejected the song, but another singer on that tour, Kenny Lynch, did record it, becoming the first person to cover a Lennon/McCartney song. The Beatles recorded this themselves when they needed material for their Please Please Me album, which was quickly released in the UK to capitalize on the success of their first 2 singles: ""Please Please Me"" and ""Love Me Do.""<br><br>A3 ""Anna (Go to Him)""<br><br>Arthur Alexander wrote this, making it one of the world's great trivia questions: Alexander is the only person to write songs that were recorded by Bob Dylan, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles. This was distributed to US disc jockeys in 1963 on a single with ""Ask Me Why."" The promotional disc is a rare collectors item. John Lennon loved this song, which is why The Beatles recorded it. According to Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn, John Lennon had a terrible cold during the recordings, thus leading to his strange vocals in the song. The subtitle (Go to Him) is a little confusing, as in both Alexander and The Beatles versions of the song, they sing ""Go with him."" In a Married With Children episode, Al can't get this song out of his head and it's killing him because he only remembers some of the line ""Go with him"" - he just sings ""Mmm Mmm him.""<br><br>A5 ""Boys""<br><br>This was originally recorded by The Shirelles, a popular female vocal quartet who were inducted into the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1996. John Lennon was a big fan of The Shirelles.<br><br>Pete Best sang lead on this during live appearances, until he was fired and replaced by Ringo Starr.<br><br>Please Please Me was recorded in one day to take advantage of The Beatles UK success. They filled the album with the singles they had released along with cover songs that were often part of their live show, which is how this made the cut. The budget for the album was 400 pounds (about $800), with each Beatle receiving a union scale pay of 29 pounds. <br><br>A6 ""Ask Me Why""<br><br>This is a very formulaic love song, but it marked the first time John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote a song together at the same time.This was released as the B-side to ""Please Please Me,"" which was the Beatles first US single. The Beatles performed at one of their early auditions for Parlophone Records when Pete Best was still their drummer. No copy of this recording exists.A copy of the promotional single given to disk jockeys in 1964 is now a collector's item worth at least $10,000.<br><br>B1 ""Love Me Do""<br><br>John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this in 1958, when John was 17 and Paul was 16. They made time for songwriting by skipping school. They had written songs before, but this was the first one they liked enough to record. McCartney wrote this about his girlfriend at the time, Iris Caldwell. This was the Beatles first single. It was released in England by Parlophone Records, but it took a while before they could get a record company to distribute it in America. The Beatles wanted Capitol Records to release it in the US, but they refused, figuring it would flop. It went to Tollie Records, who released it in America during Beatlemania, about a year after it was released in England. By 1962, The Beatles were playing regular gigs at a club in Hamburg, Germany. They played a lot of Blues covers by famous American artists, and it was a big deal for them when they introduced this into their set, as they didn't know how it would hold up against songs by Little Richard and Ray Charles. The song was well-received and gave The Beatles a lot of confidence, which led to them writing and performing more original songs. When they played this for an audition with Parlophone Records, the producer they auditioned for was George Martin, who became a key figure in Beatles history as he helped shape their sound. He started tinkering with the song right away, adding the harmonica part. Fortunately, John Lennon knew how to play the harmonica and was able to come up with something. The Beatles recorded versions of this with 3 different drummers. At their first Parlophone audition in June, 1962, Pete Best was still their drummer. When they recorded this on September 4, Ringo was their drummer, but when George Martin decided this would be the single, he had them record it again a week later. At this session, he used a session drummer named Andy White and stuck Ringo with the maracas. The version with Ringo drumming was released as the single, but the version released on the album had Andy White's drumming. Ringo didn't pitch a fit when he got bumped at the session, but was very upset and felt real insecure, especially since The Beatles had just fired a drummer. When this was released in England, it was not a big hit. The Beatles' manager, Brian Epstein, was so confident in the group that he gave the single a big marketing push by buying a bunch of copies of it (some say 10,000) for his record store, which helped get it on the charts and ensured more exposure for the band. The Beatles were very close to releasing another song as their first single. At their September 4 recording session, George Martin decided their first single should be a song called ""How Do You Do It?,"" which was written by someone else. The Beatles were not pleased and did some lackluster takes of the song before they were allowed to record ""Love Me Do."" Eventually, Martin changed his mind and went with ""Love Me Do."" ""How Do You Do It?"" became a hit for Gerry and the Pacemakers in 1964. Before they recorded this, Lennon always sang the lead vocal, but when his harmonica part was added, McCartney had to sing it because Lennon's mouth was full of harmonica. Paul claims that you can hear the fear in his voice at the audition. John stole the harmonica used in this song in a music shop in Arnhem, a Dutch town near to the German border, while the Beatles were on their way to Hamburg. Lennon's lips went numb from playing the harmonica at session. He was trying to sound like Delbert McClinton. Paul McCartney called this ""Our greatest philosophical song."" This was recorded in mono on 1-track tape. No stereo version exists. This song has been covered by The Brady Bunch, The Chipmunks, Dick Hyman, Flaco Jimenez, Madooo, The Persuasions, Sandie Shaw, Ringo Starr and Bobby Vee.When John's Aunt Mimi heard this song, she said to him ""Well, if you think you're going to make a fortune with that, you've got another thing coming."" According to Q magazine, Parlophone employees weren't impressed when George Martin presented this song to them. One staffer inquired whether English comedian Spike Milligan was behind the record.<br><br>B2 ""PS I Love You""<br><br>Paul McCartney wrote this song in Hamburg, Germany while The Beatles were the house band at The Star Club. The Beatles performed this at their Parlophone Records audition on June 6, 1962. This was used as the B-side of ""Love Me Do,"" the first Beatles release in England. It was going to be their first single, but Peggy Lee had a song out with the same title so the record company decided to release ""Love Me Do"" instead.<br><br>In 2007, a movie called P.S. I Love You was released starring Hilary Swank, Lisa Kudrow and Gerald Butler.<br><br>B3 ""Please Please Me""<br><br>Please Please Me is the only Beatles album with the original songs credited to ""McCartney/Lennon""; hereafter (and in subsequent releases of this album on CD), they would be credited as the more familiar ""Lennon/McCartney."" If you listen close, between 1:23 and 1:36 the call and response is John, Paul and George, not just John and Paul. John: ""Ohhh"", Paul, ""You know I want you too"", George ""Yeah"".<br><br>B3 ""Baby It's You""<br><br>This was written by Burt Bacharach, Mack David (Hal's older brother), and Barney Williams (a pen name of Luther Dixon). It was originally ""I'll Cherish You,"" but was re-written at the request of Dixon, who produced the track.<br><br>The Shirelles' vocals were added directly to Bacharach's demo recording.<br><br>The Beatles recorded this on their first album, Please Please Me. The Beatles also covered ""Boys"" on this, which was previously performed by The Shirelles. This was a #5 hit for the group Smith in 1969. Smith, fronted by Gayle McCormick, was managed and produced by Del Shannon, who had a #1 hit with ""Runaway."" Shannon chose the song for the group to record even though none of the members had ever heard of it before.<br><br>B4 ""Do You Want to Know a Secret""<br><br>John Lennon claimed this song came to him based on the tune ""I'm Wishing"" that his mother used to sing him from the Disney movie Snow White. In the beginning of the Disney song, Snow White is singing to the doves, ""Wanna know a secret? Promise not to tell? We are standing by a wishing well."" George Harrison sang lead. It's one of the few Beatles songs not sung by the person who wrote it. This was the first Lennon/McCartney song to be a hit for another artist - it was recorded by Billy J. Kramer with the Dakotas. Their version was #1 in England for 2 weeks. The Beatles were very close to a record deal, and John wanted to marry. Their manager Brian Epstein was very upset as he had been pitching the boys as 4 good-looking single chaps from England. John could not be talked out of the wedding so Brian made him a deal. As the 2 could not afford a honeymoon, and did not have a place of their own, he would let them use his flat for 2 weeks, with the promise that they not tell anyone they were married. In the flat on their honeymoon, for obvious reasons, John wrote ""Listen, do you want to know a secret?"" John has said that the secret in question wasn't necessarily that he was married, but that he finally realized he was actually in love. Lennon said in interviews 1971 and 1980 that he wrote this song in time for his wedding in August 1962. Most Beatles tracks were credited to Lennon/McCartney, and while the band was together, they rarely discussed who actually wrote what songs, so it wasn't until after their break-up that Lennon revealed he was the composer of this song. George Harrison said in Musician magazine that the musical inspiration for the song came from ""I Really Love You"" by the group The Stereos.<br><br>B5 ""A Taste of Honey""<br><br>""A Taste Of Honey"" has been recorded by approximately 200 artists, internationally, including The Beatles, Herb Alpert &amp; The Tijuana Brass, Barbra Streisand, Tony Bennett, Johnny Mathis just to name a few.<br><br>B6 ""There's a Place""<br><br>This was one of John Lennon's first attempts to write a song in the style of the Motown girl-groups. In this song, Lennon sings about the places he retreats to in his mind, although without a careful listen the song seems to be about a girl. This appeared on the soundtrack for the 1963 TV documentary Beat City, which is a look at the Liverpool music scene that aired on Britain's Associated-Rediffusion network. - Joe, hoboken, NJ This is most probably the first Beatles song not in the boy/girl/love theme. If there's an earlier one I'm not recalling it. Based on the lyrics this is most probably about depression.<br><br>B7 ""Twist and Shout""<br><br>A Philadelphia R&amp;B group called The Top Notes originally recorded this in 1961. It was a hit for The Isley Brothers in 1962, which is the version The Beatles emulated. Engineer Norman Smith explained how The Beatles version came about: ""Someone suggested they do 'Twist and Shout' with John taking the lead vocal. But by this time all their throats were sore; it was 12 hours since we had started working. John's, in particular, was almost completely gone so we really had to get it right the first time. The Beatles on the studio floor and us in the control room. John sucked a couple more Zubes (a brand of throat lozenges), had a bit of a gargle with milk and away we went."" The Beatles used this to end many of their early live performances. It was always a huge hit when they played it in concert, and was chosen as their opening song at their Shea Stadium performance on August 15, 1965 - the first Rock concert held in a stadium. John Lennon admitted that he screamed the lyrics. The Beatles had to sing loud when they did countless live shows in their early years. You can hear McCartney yell ""hey"" over the very last chord of this song, possibly because it was such a challenge doing the vocals with Lennon suffering from a cold (he was plagued with them his entire life). A lot of people think that the song was recorded once - a one time shot. They actually did two takes, and kept the first one. John was totally knackered, sick as a dog and had stripped off his shirt to let himself sweat it out, but he pulled it off. The next day - February 12, 1963 - The Beatles played two shows, one at the Azena Ballroom in Yorkshire and another at the Astoria Ballroom in Lancashire. In 1986, this charted again (at #23) when it was used in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. This was used in the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back To School. This was the first hit song written by Bert Berns. He went on to write songs for The Drifters, Ben E. King, and Van Morrison. He died of a heart attack in 1967.</span>,<span>Only for the performance on twist and shout this deserves 5 stars.An album that changed  the course of  music history.  I lie the innocence and pure energy of the band at that time before they started to have problems witt each other , the overblown concepts and  the double albums that are  mostly filler.</span>,<span>Tras el éxito de “Please Please Me” los Beatles graban apuradamente su primer trabajo en una época en que los álbumes no eran muy considerados al lado del reinante mercado de los singles. Por ello hay mucho relleno aquí en medio de algunas buenas originales como “I Saw Her Standing There”, “Do You Want To Know A Secret” y la primerísima “Love Me Do”, en una toma diferente del single con Andy White en lugar de Ringo. En cuanto a los covers la calidad varía con “Twist And Shout” y “Baby It’s You” como únicos puntos altos. Álbum de tremenda importancia por ser el primero en una nueva era del rock pero disparejo y clara muestra de que los Beatles recién estaban despegando.</span>,<span>""Man, we gotta start hittin' the back catalog or we'll never make any progress with our rock-n-roll reviews"", said Beauregard, the rockin' housecat. The cat further stated....I think we should tackle our Beatles collection"". ""I dunno"", I replied.......""That's a tall order. We have a bookcase full of Beatles stuff. What more could we add that has not already been commented on before by people with greater knowledge of the Beatles then either you or I?"" ""Agreed"", replied the cat. ""We'll jus' have to personalize our comments as best we can. I suggest we start at the bands' beginning with their first English release, the 1963 LP <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>"".<br><br>The rockin' housecat inserted the disk into the changer and pushed play. We listened intently to the CD and upon completion Bobo commented as follows: ""Where does one begin? Like most artists of the early '60's, PPM contains a high number of covers ranging in quality from average, such as the poppers ""Anna(Go with Him)"", ""Chains"", and ""Baby It's You""; to the good, including the rocker ""Boys"", and the pop balled, ""A Taste of Honey""; with the album concluding with a great cover of ""Twist and Shout"", where John sacrifices his vocals to the gods of rock-n-roll. Where the band stands out, even at this early stage, was with the original material. And like the covers, this material ranges from adequate (given early '60's production values) to first rate. The standout tracks include the hits, ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Love Me Do"", and the title track, ""Please, Please Me"", all great rockers. Of lessor quality are McCartney's ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""There's A Place"". While we're at it,  we'll throw in Lennon's ""Ask Me Why"" into that category. All 'n' all, I prefer the Lennon tracks to McCartney's on this release.  Hell, I even liked the Harrison vocals on the goofball ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"".  <br><br>The cat continued...""When it's all said and done, the Beatles debut, PPM, is still remarkable. It's raw with the energy of a young band with all kinds of potential, that when unleashed, would change rock-n-roll from the realm of leather clad punks to an art form (to the dismay of many).  These fellows were the real deal. Can you imagine rock-n-roll without the Beatles? I believe the rock explosion of the mid to late '60's whould have occurred without the Beatles; but the four lads from Liverpool expanded the horizons of what rock-n-roll could be and did so with such a vision that was to define a generation. It's amazing! It really is"".<br><br>""OK, Bobo, what's the call on PPM?, I asked. The cat replied...""I personally believe that every rock-n-roll fan should have the complete Beatles discography in his or her collection. However, I know that there are a number of young rockers out there with limited resources to acquire all the releases from all the Heroes of Rock, including the Beatles. Those new to the Beatles should concentrate on later albums from the bands' catelog. As your finances improve, go back and pick-up the early releases, including PPM.  You will not be disappointed"".</span>,<span>Very underrated album. Each song is very catchy!</span>,<span>A very good pop album.  If this was what the Beatles did in its entirely, they would be a decent band from the 60s.  Instead, they went on to make much greater classics and hence their amazing legacy.</span>"
"<span>O primeiro álbum dos Beatles realmente não nos revela os brilhantes trabalhos que iriam lançar anos depois. As músicas são todas baseadas em relacionamentos, romances e amores. Têm uma tirada pop que consquistava as meninas - primeiro de Liverpool, e depois do mundo - e tinham cantores bonitinhos, arrumadinhos e sorridentes.<br><br>Nesta expectativa, eu avalio este álbum muito pessoalmente e se ele tem uma nota alta, não é porque marcou o rock ou é uma obra prima - apesar de que, este álbum introduziu os Beatles na Inglaterra - mas sim porque, para mim, ele realmente faz bem aos meus ouvidos.<br><br>Os músicos, futuros gênios, já mostravam que sabiam tratar bem suas canções e, apesar de algumas serem meros covers, até nisso, eles conseguiram valorizar as versões. Twist and Shout até hoje é tocada em festas a versão Beatles e suas composições Love Me Do, Please Please Me e I Saw Her Standing There são clássicos pops daquela época e para quem curte uma música, digamos assim, mais leve.<br><br>Além destas, Chains, Ask Me Why e There's a Place mantém o álbum em um ponto alto e Do You Want to Know a Secret e A Taste of Honey dá um toque um pouco diferente. As outras completam, sem valorizar, mas mantém a composição num nível alto.</span>,<span>A solid debut from a promising young group. I'll bet this won't be the last you hear of these guys. Mark my words, they're going to be big. Maybe not Gerry and the Pacemakers big, but big nonetheless. ""Misery,"" ""Ask Me Why"" and ""There's a Place"" are my favorites. I really love ""Ask Me Why."" An underrated song, in my opinion.</span>,<span>The debut album of The Beatles. Eight songs out of 14 are their own material. Six of the songs are covers and that's not a positive thing I think. All of the songs are really short. Longest song is ""Anna (Go to Him) which is only 2 minutes and 57 seconds long. That isn't enough.<br><br>A-side begins with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" which is clearly one of the best opening tracks ever. ""Anna (Go to Him) is a fantastic cover. ""Boys"" is also very entertaining cover. Last two songs in the A-side are McCartney/Lennon songs. ""Ask Me Why"" is simple song and it works quite good. Title track was one of the first songs I heard from this band and I still like it a lot.<br><br>""Love Me Do"" starts the B-side and it's pretty good pop/rock song. Really simple rhytms and sounds, but those work here. ""P.S. I Love You"" is once again a really simple beat song. Nothing really special or memorable. Next song is called ""Baby It's You"" and it's a cover. It has really annoying ""shalalalalaa-thing"", but without that the song is OK. Another normal soft pop track. ""A Taste of Honey"" is funny and one of the strongest songs in the B-side even if it's a cover once again. Last song is ""Twist and Shout"" and it's pretty great, but overall here is clearly too much covers in this album.<br><br>I would like to give a higher rating for this album, but seriously, almost half of the songs are covers and that is the main reason why I have to low my rating. And this kind of tame 60's melodic pop release isn't my fav stuff at all. I have to say that I like the psychedelic material of this band a lot more, because this stuff is just normal pop rock. OK album.</span>,<span>No, no, no. This was not just like any album in 1963 - it differs in every bit from being just another pop/rock album. This is a singles era - it was not taken for granted that an artist made an album. And it was not common for a band to record their own material. Seriously now, what other albums were there around that could be a match? Not many, if you don´t count jazz.<br><br>This is also a very fresh, enjoyable album - maybe the most enjoyable of all the Beatles´  albums.</span>,<span>1-2-3-Fah!!! And so it begins.  Sure <a title=""[Artist121]"" href=""/artist/elvis_presley"" class=""artist""> Elvis</a>, <a title=""[Artist1608]"" href=""/artist/buddy-holly"" class=""artist"">Buddy Holly</a>, and others had preceded it.  That's the Old Testament.  This was the Big Bang.  Musicians from <a title=""[Artist467]"" href=""/artist/sting"" class=""artist"">Sting</a> to <a title=""[Artist1345]"" href=""/artist/ozzy_osbourne"" class=""artist"">Ozzy Osbourne</a> would later attest: this was the moment that rock and roll music captivated them and determined the future course of their lives.  George Martin famously quipped, ""Gentleman, you've just recorded your first number one!"".  He was right more than he knew.  <a title=""[Album17]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/please-please-me-64/"" class=""album"">Please Please Me</a> was the touchstone.  The legacy of <a title=""[Album17]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/please-please-me-64/"" class=""album""> this album</a> stretches like a long shadow over the history of modern music.  It's influence knows no bounds.<br><br>What of the content?  Well, quite fittingly it's a snapshot of <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist""> The Fabs</a> stage set from a moment in time.  <a title=""[Artist59]"" href=""/artist/john-lennon"" class=""artist""> Winston Legtheigh</a> and <a title=""[Artist338]"" href=""/artist/paul-mccartney-1"" class=""artist""> Macca</a> are still finding their feet as songwriters.  Many of the compositions like ""Anna (Go To Him)"" and ""Ask Me Why"" attest to that fact.  The highlights nonetheless remain enthralling over sixty years later.  ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Please Please Me"" are pure rock and roll.  They have forfeited none of their capacity to enthrall over time.  Remember please that <a title=""[Artist59]"" href=""/artist/john-lennon"" class=""artist""> Lennon</a> chose ""I Saw Her Standing There for performance during his last live appearance in 1976.  The harmonica intro in ""Love Me Do"" is full of such poignance.  Hindsight teaches that it was the sound of divine inspiration for so much more.  They were riding a tidal wave all through 1970.</span>,<span>A very solid deput.  Many of the songs are covers and the originals are not perfect, but relative to what else was out at this time this album is a winner.</span>,<span>I must say I'm not too fond with the Beatles' early days, they made good music, but it sounds really 60's-boy-band inspired, the surprise elements that make the latter Beatles albums absolutely fantastic are nowhere to be found here, standard musicianship, and nothing too revolutionary here. (Well, I'm talking about it like that cause nowadays you hear every kind of stuff, but back in the day this must have been really groundbreaking, it was not luck that the band became the biggest selling act of all time in the history of popular music, it was because they came along with material no one had even dreamed about before.) But the true question is, What makes the Beatles so likable and appealing in this record? The answer is rather simple: like I mentioned before, standard musicianship. That's truly the reason why this has really catchy tunes. Be realistic, regular people who don't have major musical knowledge will rather much listen to the catchy and popular stuff than something completely avant-garde and musically complex, cause normally complexity in music brings rather long and inaccessible tunes, this on the other hand is really simple and catchy music, and ahead of it's time. (in some ways, few if any bands had ever thought about presenting rock and roll the way these guys do on this record.) So there you go, a simple, dated, and historic record that most likely you will like (if you're into the Beatles of course, or if you like music from this kind of time.</span>,<span>Probably The Beatles' worst album. Hey, they were new, so you have to give these guys a break, but the shmaltsy lyrics, and the simple melodies seem pretty dated. The boys from Liverpool would do much better, trust me.<br><br>Standout tracks include ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"", ""Love Me Do"", and of course, ""Twist and Shout"", the freshest piece on the album.</span>"
"<span>Today, Pete Best's birthday, inspired me to write a review. And seeing as how I don't have any Pete Best Band records lying around, this will have to suffice.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, the Beatles' debut album of course, recorded in less than ten hours, was released in 1963, a year ruled by such classics as Lesley Gore's ""It's My Party"" and the Ronettes' ""Be My Baby"" (well, to the latter's credit, is IS the definitive song of Phil Spector's Wall of Sound). I once had a friend who complained that trite lyrics ruined this album. Must consider time period....""it's my party and I'll cry if I want to/cry if I want to/cry if I want to"" is no worse than anything on here. Except maybe ""Boys."" But they didn't even write that.<br><br>Anyway, in 1963, this was quite the album, as looking at the hits singles of that epoch, all of the songs on here hold up favorably with them. Unfortunately, this is one of the few Beatles albums that hasn't dated well, as it sounds like silly, emotionless bubblegum pop nowadays. But hey! Everyone has to start somewhere, don't they? ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Please Please Me,"" and John Lennon's throat shredding vocal on ""Twist and Shout"" are definitely very good songs, and I always enjoyed ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"" too, whether it's the vocal hook or something I don't know. Oh, and the hit on here (at least, the BIG hit) was ""Love Me Do,"" indeed the first Beatles single, and it always bored me, because it's more trite than anything on here. Which is an accomplishment.<br><br>Of the Lennon/McCartney (McCartney/Lennon?) originals, I already mentioned the rockin' lead track, and the fun title track, and the first single. The other standout on here I'd say is ""There's a Place,"" which actually has to do with the mind lyrically and now teenage love and angst, as 99% of other singles did at this time, and for that I must give it a nod. ""P.S. I Love You"" is an interesting Paul ballad that I've heard too many times, ""Ask Me Why"" is generally not memorable, and ""Misery"" is OK, although it's quite an odd marriage of lyrics and music. Then the obligatory covers - six of them here - most performed well enough, although I've never actually gone and dug up the originals to listen to so I can't really compare for you. Then again, you probably haven't heard the originals either. And if you have, I applaud you. ""Chains"" is another odd marriage of music and lyrics, although that isn't their fault - they perform it nicely. ""Anna"" has cool harmony parts in the back and that's about it. And it's completely odd hearing Ringo sing about ""Boys."" I mean, really, what compelled them to cover this song? Ah well, they change the lyrics enough to make it less gay, and we all know Ringo isn't gay - he married a Bond girl, for heaven's sakes! ""Baby It's You"" is alright, ""A Taste of Honey"" is too much Paul sap for me, and of course ""Twist and Shout"" is on here too.<br><br>Beatles get bonus points for great performances here and a huge number of good originals (remember, at this point in time, most groups weren't writing their own songs, much less their own hits) and the covers. It's an important album, but it sure sounds like an artifact of 1963. Approach with caution. And with an open mind. Pretend it's 1963. And remember, within 9 months of release of this album, Beatlemania reached America in full force. Amazing how little time it took.</span>,<span>Good old fashioned rock 'n' roll. This and the other early albums until Rubber Soul should not be compared with the later works.</span>,<span>Got it over the summer, quickly's become one of my favorite albums. is it blasphemy to say i like this one more than revolver and sgt peppers (maybe even combined)?! if so, then im going to hell!</span>,<span>The first Beatles outting isn't sold gold like much of their later stuff, but it is a solid album.  It has a couple of real great hits like ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Love Me Do,"" ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and ""Twist and Shout.""  There are other songs that show glimpses into what the Beatles will become.  I'm not in love with this album, but it shows the groups great potential.  The large number of covers hurt the album a little, but the vocals are really amazing.</span>,<span>Ah.. so sweet.<br>I wasn't born when this was released. But It's been something like 15 years since I first listened to it, and It still chills me everytime I listen to ""A Taste of Honey"", ""There's a Place"", ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"". <br>Hell of a debut.<br><br>(500th rate)</span>,<span>Nice and very well-behaved!</span>,<span>The Beatles are my favourite band, but their early stuff can be a bit patchy. This is the last Beatles album I bought, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how good it is.</span>,<span>Un très bon album de début, un sens mélodique déjà très affiné et une alchimie dans les voix. Pas mal de reprises mais le groupe se les accapare à merveille. Sans doute un des meilleurs de la première période du groupe.</span>"
"<span>Basic good time rock'n'roll.</span>,<span>Impactante primer Album de los cuatro chicos de Liverpool. 14 canciones muy buenas muy superiores a cuánto se escuchaba por aquella época,The Beatles estavan años luz de los demás.En el futuro crearian obras mucho mejores,pero este album ofrecian unas harmonias vocales jamás oidas y un gran acompañamiento musical con un Ringo Star muy contudente en la bateria.<br>""P.S.I Love You"",una de sus primeras composiciones es genial,aún hoy en dia me pone la carne de gallina con Paul descendiéndo vocalmente.P.S.I Love Yooooouuuuu Uh,Uh ,Uh Uh.Verdaderamente Genios - Five Stars</span>,<span>My first Beatles CD. It's alright, but they haven't reached their full potential yet</span>,<span>No rated highly generally.  I find the RNR covers irrestible.  Lovely album that needs one to be familiar with their influences</span>,<span>01 - I Saw Her Standing There: 7<br>02 - Misery: 6<br>03 - Anna (Go to Him): 7<br>04 - Chains: 6<br>05 - Boys: 6<br>06 - Ask Me Why: 7<br>07 - Please Please Me: 10<br>08 - Love Me Do: 7<br>09 - P.S.

""Please Please Me"" is the definite stand out here, with ""P.S. I Love You"" and ""Twist and Shout"" the other memorable tracks. The rest are average (although ""Love Me Do"" is the most famous) 60's pop that, if it wasn't The Beatles, would have probably been forgotten now. Overall though, a solid pop album, which shows a little promise towards what would happen in the not too distant future.</span>,<span>yeah!yeah!yeah; the Beatles very early on ;just finding their way-not great yet</span>,<span>The idea of reviewing a Beatles album should be a very scary one for any serious reviewer. Why? Well, The Beatles have a very frustrating place in music. Their immense popularity can cause a giant backlash if you give them anything less than a perfect score, but you can also get just as much backlash for rating them highly just because not liking popular acts gets you mad-indie points... and who's more popular than The Beatles? When it comes right down to it any reviewer needs to ask themselves if they should even bother, the effort and risk in reviewing a Beatles isn't even worth it when you think about it. A band as colossally popular as The Beatles is going to get listens just because they feel obligated to, it's <em class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles.</em> No matter what you write your credibility ends up coming into question; you're either just like every other reviewer over-fellating the group or you're just some ignorant young'un who just wants indie credz.<br><br>I love The Beatles. Love them. I grew up listening to them, I remember when my dad would make mix-tapes for my brother and I to listen to, the Beatles embodies my childhood. However, if I were to make a soundtrack to my childhood, not one of them would feature a song from the soulless bunk that is their debut, Please Please Me. The only reason anyone still cares about Please Please Me is because of the band name attached to it. It's conventional, dreary 60's pop right down to it's appallingly ugly cover.<br><br>Speaking of covers, this album has a lot of them. In 1963, the Beatles were far from the songwriting lords they became later on in the decade. Apparently, The Beatles knew this themselves which led to almost half of the album to consist of covers. The band's current ineptitude with the pen also contributed to the band drawing influences from most of the songs they covered (and songs like them), so now you have a collection of pop songs you've heard before and songs that sound like songs you've heard before on this very record. It doesn't take long before the album meshes into a forgettable humdrum mess of sound.<br><br>Even still, you can't deny that Please Please Me starts out on a rather... wait for it... <em class=""rymfmt"">pleasing</em> note (HA!) with McCartney's ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" an energetic number that catches the listener's attention immediately and gets your head bopping with it's fun, rockin' nature. This energized mood is instantly ruined by Lennon's ""Misery"" though, a mid-paced mopefest about a ""lost love."" Not horribly offensive, but it's unimpressive and disappointing considering the quality opener. I'd take this song over the string of boring covers that come in it's wake though. These covers are so uninspired and boring I'm not going to mention them much at all, it's sad to see Harrison's debut on vocals is wasted on the bore that is the country-tinged ""Chains"" by The Cookies, which is only more embarrassing by the silly back-up vocals. These covers are all molasses-slow and drained of any sense of enthusiasm.<br><br>It's pretty bad when ""Ask Me Why"" becomes a highlight of the album, considering you aren't so bored you stopped paying attention. Another Lennon-penned slow, love song with more shameful back-up vocals (WOO-WOO-WOO-WOOOOO) is another terrible song, but interesting simply because it's not a goddamn cover. Things pick up a little with ""Please Please Me"" a slightly out of tune ditty with some catchy bits that are quite keen. Things pick up even more with the solid ""Love Me Do,"" probably the biggest number on the album today (though it wasn't a hit in 1963 like ""Please Please Me"" was), it's overall harmonica-driven rawness really sets it apart from the glossy pop-drivel that makes up the rest of the album. ""Love Me Do"" is flawed though, the lyrics are probably their weakest and it's highly repetitious, even still it's one of the best songs on Please Please Me.<br><br>After that, the album goes on for the while the same way it did before with boring sappy love songs; ""PS I Love You,"" ""Baby It's You"" (ANOTHER COVER), ""Do You Want To Know A Secret,"" and ""A Taste Of Honey"" (ANOTHER. COVER.). After that string of bore you're rewarded with the last original composition on the album, Lennon's ""There's A Place,"" the lyrics are stronger here but it's instantly forgettable when the astounding cover of ""Twist And Shout"" makes it's introduction. The Beatles are just brimming with the energy they must have been keeping pent up throughout the rest of the album. ""Twist And Shout"" is an excellent closer, with Lennon's strong hoarse vocals the band shrieking themselves into the final verses. It's just so fun and irresistible, it can't save the album, but it at least gives you a reason to not throw the album away.<br><br>It wasn't any good in 1963 and it sure as hell isn't any good in 2008, The Beatles really didn't deserve a record deal at this point, and you'd never think that this was the band that would eventually put out Abbey Road. This debut is almost forgivable for the band's youth, but that doesn't make it any less awful. Generic 60's-pop through-and-through, now give me some indie cred.</span>,<span>4,5 stars might be a bit much, but this album just makes me happy</span>"
"<span>Early Beatles sounding so good!! “Love Me Do”, “Do You Want To Know A Secret”, “Twist And Shout” and “Please Please Me”. An album full of songs you know and love.</span>,<span>It's a little uneven, but it still shines.  Lennon's version of Twist and Shout is absolutely definitive, being a terrific example of raw and unbridled rock n' roll.  The rest of the covers fare a little worse, their flaws being more with the material itself than with the Beatles' performances.  The originals are what really seals the deal here, and it's quite easy to see that even at this point in their careers, they were capable of writing great songs, not just playing them.  And they would only get better from here.</span>,<span>A strong debut by my favorite band of all time. There isn't really a bad song on here, which cannot be said about some of the other early 60s Beatles albums, and there are some very strong numbers including ""Please Please Me,"" ""Love Me Do,""  ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Do You Want to Know a Secret,"" and ""Ask Me Why."" I feel that this is the beginning of real Rock and Roll.</span>,<span>This looks like it is just 'Please Please Me', but with ""Love Me Do"" missing, as well as maybe one other track. I gave 'Please Please Me' a solid 3.5/5, but since one of the best songs was ""Love Me Do"" I wouldn't check this out.</span>,<span>Just a good pop album. There are some great songs (""I Saw Her Standing There"", the title track, ""Love Me Do"", ""Twist and Shout""), some good songs (""Please Please Me"", ""P.S. I Love You"", ""Anna""..) and some songs I could quite easily live without. The times I listen through this - instead of just picking and choosing a few songs - are rare; the sound is just too abrasive. Not a bad record then, but no kind of indication of what was to come.</span>,<span>The 50's ended with BUDDY HOLLY and started the 60's started with this record.<br><br>Millions have been trying to clone it since.</span>,<span>This album is extremely dated, bland, and boring.  It is amazing how this band went on to do what they did, and make some really great albums.  This is an album consisting of a lot of covers which is its biggest flaw because The Beatles' original material here is far better.  Sadly even the original material is mostly below average and dated. <br><br>Of the 14 songs, I recommend the following 3 (21%).<br><br>Please Please Me, Love Me Do, Twist And Shout.</span>,<span>As far as four youngsters kicking around writing fun catchy songs goes, this was a solid debut. But who could have possibly imagined upon this release the heights this band would ultimately reach?</span>"
"<span>Best Song: Please Please Me<br><br>Other Highlights: I Saw Her Standing There, Misery, P.S. I Love You, Twist and Shout</span>,<span>I hate doing this, seriously, but this is a ""weak"" Beatles album. It hurts me to say, but everyone has off-albums, and this was their first, not to mention it is still better than many albums people think are classics. Its flaws are obvious: two many covers, lacks energy, weak lyrics, etc. but that is not to go without stating there are some masterpieces on this album, ""Love Me Do"", ""I Saw Her Standing There"", and, one of my top 10 favorite covers, ""Twist and Shout"". Which easily alone make this album a 3.5/5. The rest of the songs range from just good, to pretty poor. Still worth owning, especially if you are a Beatles fan. I may bump this rating to 4/5 when I listen to it some more times.</span>,<span>This contains most of my least favourite Beatles songs ... 'Chains' chief amongst them. <br><br>Fun album to play at the Mod club, but obviously one of the lesser Beatle releases.</span>,<span>""Twist and shout"", ""Love me do"", ""Please please me"", ""I Saw her standing there"", and that's all folks. This first Beatles album is their worse, because it's very old-fashion.<br>Anyway, 2.5 stars, because it's the Beatles, and Beatles are probably the most important rock band of all time.</span>,<span>Twist and shout is the best song on this album.</span>,<span>Nice enough pop 60's pop music.  Nothing else.</span>,<span>The songwriting hasn't fully blossomed yet, as should be expected from any band on their debut album. But of course The Beatles weren't just any band, and the compositions are already remarkable. ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a raucous opener, matched in ferocity only by the closer, ""Twist and Shout,"" with some of the most orgasmic wails ever recorded. The rest of the classics--""Love Me Do,"" ""Baby It's You,"" ""Do You Want to Know a Secret?""--are all hooky, innocent pop songs whose sound marks them of their time, but whose universality and spirit render timeless. The other tracks are largely in the same mold, with strong originals and covers that the band had been working on and playing for years. In fact, the album was recorded in less than ten hours; if you ever wanted to attend an early Beatles concert, this is as close as you'll get on record. Youthful energy, vitality, and playfulness permeate the entire album, and yet they still don't approach the heights they would ascend in the years to come.</span>,<span>Recorded in only one day (except for the singles, which were already there), the first work of the Beatles is quite a genuine merseybeat affair with some oddities that I'll point out if I have time. The fact is, in the first place, that the Beatles based their live impact on sheer and instinctive musical ability (=they couldn't play, but they did anyway and they played loud); when it comes to record an album and you're in the first part of the 60s, you can't play loud. So in ""Please Please Me"", the Beatles' instrumental flaws all come to surface, when they try to be a gentle pop affair, despite being something nearer to a garage-rock band. The second thing is that McCartney's and (especially) Lennon's songwriting is childish, immature and often irritating in its bleakness. McCartney will grow up notably as an author, Lennon will remain tied to his style but somewhat improve it; but here, we are in pre-historic times. ""There's a Place"", ""Ask Me Why"", ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" (for Lennon) and the mellow ""P.S. I Love You"" (for McCartney) are surely some of the band's worst songs ever. On the other hand, I appreciate the (bit of) rawness in ""I Saw Her Standing There"" (a furious rock'n'roll by McCartney) and the call-and-response of ""Please Please Me"". Also the covers are dull, exception made for ""Boys"", sung by Ringo, which is quite good (even if the guy can't sing, he does it with simpathy and force.</span>"
"<span>The classic debut from worldwide sensation, the Beatles, is not quite a perfect masterpiece, but collects some great original tunes with a smathering of cover tracks that are a mixed bag.<br><br>The strong material here is absolutely brilliant. Opener I Saw Her Standing There is a bonafide classic, and is followed up by two understated Beatles cuts, Misery and Anna (Go to Him). The album briefly falls flat with a duo of dull covers, Chains and Boys. Ask Me Why picks up the slack a bit, but feels restrained amongst the other giant rock 'n roll tracks on the disc, including the following track and smash hit/title track, Please Please Me.<br><br>Following the title track, should this have been the LP version, would be a nearly flawless Side B. Many of my favourite Beatles songs are contained on the latter half of this album -- and it is absolutely manditory listening for anyone even remotely interested in the Beatles or 60's rock. The weakest track on this second half is the original There's A Place which, although quite good, comes across as being more of a filler track used to equate to a balanced 14 songs.<br><br>Although not a perfect debut album, there are easily a solid 10 tracks on this album that should be listened to by ... well, by everyone. A number of paint-by-numbers, generally unexciting covers and a decent but not fantastic original mars this classic album, but only slightly. One of the most imporant records in the history of music.</span>,<span>Whereas the first Rolling Stones albums are much appreciated, the first Beatles albums who contained covers too (and even fewer !) aren't as well rated. The first four Beatles album, with the exception of ""A Hard Day's Night"", considered as their real first masterpiece, are just seen as the albums to have only to complete your collection. The numerous songs taken to Chuck Berry, Carl Perkins, Goffin-King...show that the Beatles can't get away from their influences at that time, but they work really well and I can listen to them as easily as the Beatles'originals. <br><br>Some of the covers are even better than the originals and can't be separated from the band's trajectory. For example, it's really a gas to listen to John Lennon singing (and losing his voice !) on the catchy Twist And Shout. I personnally like a lot the sad Anna (Go To Him) and the breezy Chains, greatly played and sung just in one take.<br><br>Many people think that the Beatles'originals on the first albums aren't classics, only padding, the good ones just present on the singles...I don't agree because Please Please Me contains Do You Want To Know A Secret sung in an innocent way by George Harrison, or Misery...and even the singles Love Me Do or Please Please Me. <br><br>A good way in, the psychedelic stuffs will come later and we can really appreciate the coherence of a band hardened by years on tour.</span>,<span>The problem with The Beatles' debut album is that it isn't an album. It's a collection of cover songs and singles. I do like the ""Please Please Me"", ""Twist and Shout"", ""I Saw Her Standing There"", and ""Do You Want to Know A Secret?"", though.<br><br>Let's use this analogy: <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is to <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em>, as primates are to humans.</span>,<span>I have always appreciated music reviews that take into context when and how a album was made. The when and how for the Beatles debut album was 1963 using what is now considered primitive recording technolgy and equipment.<br>A appropriate sports analogy would be seeing Tiger Woods play golf with Bobby Jones' clubs of the 1920's. Think the results would be the same ?<br>For those who don't ""get"" what all the Beatle fuss was about and how they made such a lasting impact. I suggest you review the record charts before the Beatles debut and after. The pre Beatle recording artist were swept away over night by Beatle imitators (British  Invasion bands) and newly spawned American bands (ex. Byrds, Lovin Spoonful). <br>From the  opening salvo of "" I saw her standing there"" until the final cresendo of ""Twist and Shout"" the Beatles debut album made an historic statement.<br>During a time when most singers and bands didn't write any of their material the remarkable thing wasn't the covers the Beatles performed on their debut but how few they actually did.<br>Furthermore, In my opinion their reworking of those songs were a vast improvement on the originals. Considering these guys were barely out of their teenage years the confidence and swagger they demonstrate on their initial recordings is amazing. <br>Highly reccommend this album and suggest you crank the volume way up. If this doesn't get you rockin you may not have a pulse.</span>,<span>Besides ""I saw her Standing There"" the Lennon/McCartney songs didn't have any calibur as there later stuff. There Covers are good, not great, I kinda wish The Beatles would Have changed it up a little bit to make it there own.</span>,<span>This wasn't certainl the best album from the Mersey Boys, and its sound got old, but it remains a very honorable first album for the future greatest band of all time.<br><br>Highlights contain ""Twist and Shout"" (John's voice seems about to break - the album was recorded on one day and this was the last song they played, and you hear it on John's throat), ""I Saw Her Standing There"", a nice rock'n roll number from Paul, ""Please Please Me"" and ""Misery"".<br><br>""Love Me Do"" is venerated because it was the first single but it's an average song. Lots of songs are alike, dull love songs with pathetic lyrics. This will get better. The true new sound of the Beatles will be defined on Hard Day's Night - coincidentally, the first album featuring no cover !</span>,<span>This is the debut album from the group that would go on to become a worldwide phenomenon.<br><br>The album starts with 'I Saw Her Standing There' which is a great RocknRoll style song. It's easy to fall in love with this song. One can see major influences from Little Richard in this song as it's style is such. Quickly following up is 'Misery'. You may think this is a slow depressing record judging by the title but it is actually quite fast and enjoyable. <br><br>Anna (Go To Him) was not written by the Beatles orignally. It is slow but quite a good song. The next two songs, are Chains and Boys. They are both similar and use similar techniques with 'Boys' giving Ringo the vocal spotlight.<br><br>Ask Me Why is probably the slow track of the album. I found it alright but not as good as the rest of the album. Please Please Me is a sweet surprise as the album quickly re-changes speed. The harmonica features at the start and was also used in Love Me Do which is the first song of the B-side and also the most familliar. <br><br>P.S. I Love You and Baby It's You are both similar and are brilliant love songs. Do You Want To Know A Secret is one of my favourites by George Harrison. The comes a Taste Of Honey which features a dual voiced Paul. There's A Place is short and sweet with a simple message.<br><br>The album concludes with a great rocker called Twist And Shout. You'll Love it. All in all, tha album was a good start for the Beatles and is a pleasure to own</span>,<span>i have a lot of beatles stuff so it isn´t listed in my profile<br>i have over 200 beatles albums contains a lot of bootlegs ;)</span>"
"<span>I love this album from start to finish. It gives a great look into the rawness of the early Beatles.</span>,<span>Le tout premier album du groupe legendaire que fut les Beatles...<br><br>Malgré le nombre important de reprises, cet album respire le renouveau du rock and roll, et ce, sur les terres de sa bonne vieille majesté...<br><br>Des chansons d'anthologie comme Twist and Shout, I saw her standing there, Love me do, ou encore Please, Please me...</span>,<span>First album, first 5 stars.</span>,<span>Pour un coup d'essais, c'était tout de même plutôt réussi! Les grands anciens nous apprenne encore aujourd'hui comment faire du bon rock. Difficile de donner une appréciation, c'est comme si on devait donner un avis sur les pyramide d'egypte ou sur la tour eiffel. Voilà, c'est là, ça fait partie de notre histoire et c'est déjà énorme</span>,<span>Great flaming Jeebus, but I love this album.<br>Not enough people listen to this one, which is sad, considering it has to be one of the best debut albums of all time.  Not even just as a debut and a precursor of the things they would do later, but in and of itself.  ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Love Me Do,"" and ""Do You Want To Know A Secret?"" have got to be two of the best, most singable bits of music ever.  I just nearly called them the 'most lickable' and it struck me as so true I'm sticking with it.  This is the most lickable album I know.</span>,<span>Beatles'ın ilk albümü. İnanılmaz çiğ bir albüm. Beatle'ların yalnızca Rock'n'Roll'dan değil R&amp;B ve Motown'dan da etkilendiklerini çok açık bir şekilde gösteriyor. 1963 yılı için yepyeni bir şey, harika bir sentez. Kanımca albümün en iyi şarkısı ""Please Please Me"".</span>,<span>A great debut.  Already this was the best album anyone had done.  It would be surpassed by their next 2 albums!</span>,<span>From the opening count-in of ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to the last anguished howl of ""Twist And Shout"", this is an amazing debut. Mixing originals with well-chosen covers (mostly girl group and early soul records), it's a record that impresses with the sheer joy and exuberance of the music. Lost gem: ""There's A Place"", which matches ""In My Room"" for sheer introspection but does it with impeccable harmonies, a driving beat and a ghostly harmonica. Could anyone who heard this in 1963 be in any doubt that these guys were going places?</span>"
"<span>The Beatles first ever album! Hit in 1963 and still sounds fine today! Not their best, but better than most albums by most other bands! ""Love Me Do"", ""Twist And Shout"", ""Please Please Me"", ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"", ""There's A Place"", etc, etc, all classic songs that earnt this album a Number 1 placing on the charts. <br><br>While ""There's a place"" sounds like it had probably only just been written, and also sounds rushed, it is still a great song and one of my favorites here. This is a great album and many probably didn't think The Beatles would be able to keep this quality of music up, but, as we all know now, they just got better and better over the years and that is really saying something!!</span>,<span>The Beatles first attempt in the USA. It's not quite ""Please Please Me"" (their debut UK album, which contains all these songs and more!) but The Beatles are so great, that this album is still a joy to play!</span>,<span>It was presumably recorded in one day. It shows ... but still perhaps their best. In a way</span>,<span>This must've sounded like some sort of miracle in 63', or maybe absolute garbage.  While most debuts from the era had sloppy beginnings of the band's songwriting mixed with some rather hit or miss covers, Please Please Me perfects everything that was done at the time.  The early Lennon/Paul songs are classics, ""Love Me Do, ""Please Please Me"", and “Misery"".  The biggest surprise here is how the covers aren't filler, but the highlight.  ""Anna (Go to Him)"" is like nothing else from the era, and probably could be mistaken for a 90s hit.  Burt Bacharach's ""Baby It's You"" is a stunner too.  But best of all, you get to hear Ringo ""talkin' about boys""!</span>,<span>The Beatles' cover of ""Twist and Shout"" is possibly the most influential vocal recordings of all time. John Lennon brought screaming vocals into popular Rock n Roll. This paved the way for such artists as Janis Joplin, and genres like Heavy Metal. This whole album is good, but the last track is, without a doubt, one of the most important in the history of Rock n Roll.</span>,<span>I still consider this one of the giants among the Beatles' repertoire. Never again would they sound this<em> alive.</em> The 14 songs on this album show them going between brilliant early Lennon/McCartney pieces and great covers of pop gems from the 50s/early 60s. The great technological breakthroughs of their later career are generally touted as their masterpieces, but I see this as one of the greatest peaks of the hurricane that was The Beatles.</span>,<span>Once I got used to the fact a lot of this was much more rock’n’roll than rock/pop I started to enjoy it.  Having said that, tracks 2-6 are a bit rubbish so be patient.</span>,<span>By the standards of later Beatles albums, Please Please Me is almost pedestrian. The production is about as basic as it gets, the songwriting is immature (they were rather young, though), and almost half of the songs are covers. So in essence, early Beatles is less well written and it lacks the bells and whistles of their later stuff. Even so, it's a lot better debut than some bands of the sixties had (see The Beach Boys or the Kinks) and they had to start somewhere. Already Lennon and McCartney showed great talent as songwriters, and though it's not as exciting stylistically as later stuff the group has a lot of energy and passion which sort of makes up for it. Please Please Me is a bit patchy, but there are several great songs. Love Me Do is maybe a little overplayed, but it's still one of their best songs, with great harmonies and a memorable harmonica lead. The title track is also great, but the best song is one that's rarely mentioned, Misery, complete with a piano solo in the bridge. The rest is more of a mixed bag. The album opens with the memorable I Saw Her Standing There and there are some other good songs like PS I Love You (though it's almost too saccharine), but some of the cover songs are not convincing, and A Taste of Honey is very dull and average, if not outright bad, though it wasn't a good song to begin with. I can't help but feel that if Please Please Me was not a Beatles album then it wouldn't be remembered too fondly, but that doesn't mean it's a bad album.</span>"
"<span>The Purest record of the Fab Four!</span>,<span>""The Beatles"" are my favorite band by far, and I love this album. For a first album it kicks butt! All of the songs add a little something extra to this magnificent album. Also, all of the songs are addicting to listen to many times; it's very early ""beatles"", and they weren't on drugs yet!</span>,<span>When The Beatles made their debut album in 1963, albums (LP's) had yet to become the predominant format, as singles (45's) still dominated the industry. That fact becomes rather evident when one considers their first LP, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, a tentative mixture of originals and covers. It's certainly not a bad album, and it was probably a stellar rock'n'roll album back in its day, but it doesn't stand up well against subsequent Beatles albums.<br><br>This debut album certainly starts out well. ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</strong>"" is a McCartney-written (Lennon contributed) rocker that was never released as a single in the UK, although it was certainly good enough to have been. The best non-single on the album, and a classic.<br><br>Lennon's ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Misery</strong>"" is next. This is probably one of the better Beatle originals on the album. The lyrics are nothing special, as the Beatles had yet to begin giving much thought to the words. <br><br>A cover of ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Anna (Go to Him)</strong>"" follows. Sung by Lennon, this one has a certain innocent charm to it. Not a bad choice for the group. It fit with their early sound nicely.<br><br>Another cover, ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Chains</strong>,"" gave George Harrison his first lead vocal. This song is a little corny. It is pretty clear that a few of the songs on this record served no purpose other than to give George and Ringo sweet, inoffensive tunes to sing.<br><br>""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Boys</strong>,"" another non-original, is laughable. Why is Ringo singing about boys? Why? Why? When you cover a song that was written for a female to sing, you have to change the words to suit a male singer. It should be ""Girls""!<br><br>Another Lennon song, ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Ask Me Why</strong>,"" is next. Some fans don't like this song, but I do. It sounds like a pretty mature effort by Lennon to my ears.<br><br>The classic ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</strong>"" is yet another Lennon tune. This was their first BIG hit in the UK. It's an exciting record, and, while the lyrics are not exactly terrific, they are perhaps the best on any Beatle original on the album.<br><br>I've never liked ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Love Me Do</strong>,"" a McCartney tune. It just isn't much of a song. The harmonica riff is probably the most interesting thing on it. Reportedly, the only reason this song was a hit was because Brian Epstein bought 10,000 copies. That would explain its success, as it reached #17 (I think) in the British charts.<br><br>""<strong class=""rymfmt"">P.S. I Love You</strong>"" is another McCartney contribution. It's got a sweetness to it. Nice tune.<br><br>""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Baby It's You</strong>"" is a fairly inspired cover sung by Lennon. He delivers some intense, scratchy vocals when he sings, ""Don't want nobody, nobody...""<br><br>Lennon wrote ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Do You Want to Know a Secret</strong>,"" a song on which George sings lead. This one is syrupy sweet and pretty slight, really. I guess that's why John gave it to George to sing.<br><br>A cover of ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">A Taste of Honey</strong>"" is next. Very corny.<br><br>""<strong class=""rymfmt"">There's a Place</strong>"" is a gem tucked away at the end of the album. John and Paul both sing on this one. It's short and sweet, with some of the best lyrics on the album, although that's not saying much.<br><br>Just as The Beatles began their debut in style, they also end it in style with a ferocious cover of the Isley Brothers' ""<strong class=""rymfmt"">Twist and Shout</strong>,"" sung--screamed, really--by Lennon. It's certainly one of the better cuts on the album.<br><br>You've got to start somewhere! Hints of brilliance are interspersed with moments of cringe-inducing corniness. Not bad for 1963.</span>,<span>I don't really get the pre-<em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> Beatles.  Really simple, kind of snarky ass-kissing music.  Aren't-we-cute-don't-you- really-like-us-you'll-be-wanting-to-join-the-fan-club-then music.  These guys were really bastards and it'd be nice if that came through a little more in the music.</span>,<span>Like Elvis' first album, in order to appreciate The Beatles' debut, you have to imagine what music was like at that time. Context people, it's all context.<br><br>Between Elvis' trip to the army and <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> rock music went from dangerous to wimpy. A pattern that's been repeated ad nauseam ever since. Where we used to have the generational warfare of the dangerous hip-shaking Elvis and crazies like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis, literally fucking America's children. <br><br>But the early sixties had watered down rock, like Fabian and other rockers whose teeth sparkled when looked at in a certain light. Nice boys.<br><br>Enter Liverpool's gift to the world. Although <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is full of slower love songs, there was a bit of the dangerous excitement in songs like the title track, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and their raw and improved cover of ""Twist and Shout."" Nobody knew it at the time, but pale faced English lads were going to start to take the place of baby-faced crooners and electric guitars were a must-have acquisition. <br><br>Elvis may have written the book (or stolen the book) but the Beatles, after a thorough proof read, re-edited the thing, gave it a dozen more chapters and were smart enough to leave the ending open so others could add onto it.<br><br>The most amazing story in rock for so many people started here. <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> should be owned for that reason alone, the fact that the originals are strong and the re-makes equally great, means that you'll also enjoy owning it.<br><br>As a warning when listening to light weight Beatles songs like ""Ask Me Why"", it's best not to think that ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" would be created by these same men three short years later, many a music fans' head has exploded pondering that amazing fact.</span>,<span>So it pretty much begins here, and what a beginning it is!  Although early Beatles songs aren't necessarily as ""accomplished"" as their later masterpieces, they definitely have an entirely different appeal.  They are really tight sounding, they sound like they are having fun the feeling is infectious.  As far as gigantic hits go this one has ""Twist And Shout"" (which I think is the definitive version, and I love the guts behind it), ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"" and ""I Saw Her Standing There"", and how can anyone argue with those?  The non-hits are well not quite as magnificent, but they are all well crafted and excellently performed.  This album is so full of youthful energy and fantastic harmonies, it's very easy to see why they became the biggest band in the world.  If you are looking to start with their earlier material, I'd recommend here first, not just because it is their debut, but because it really shows their drive and heck it has four huge singles that everyone loves.   I think the more I experience their albums as a whole the bigger fan I become!</span>,<span>The Beatles' first American album and the American version of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>.  If you like <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, you'll like this.  It's a great album.</span>,<span>With 4 tracks as great as ""I saw her standing there"", ""Love me do"", the title track and ""Twist and shout"" it would be unfair to rate this lower than 3 stars. Their cover of Arthur Alexander's ""Anna (go to him)"" is also quite good. But the rest of the album is so mediocre the tracks could have been recorded by any of their contemporaries. Had this been the only thing they ever recorded this album would have been forgotten soon. But now, just because it has the name The Beatles on it some people regard it as a classic. It isn't a classic, a vehicule for releasing the aforementioned tracks is closer to the truth. But then, the same thing can be said for just about all of the records released in the early 60s.</span>"
"<span>Pace-setting pop groups usually make sure that their 1st long player is a revolutionary call to arms. An out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new document reflecting ever-changing times. The Stones, Byrds, Velvets, Doors, Hendrix, Family Stone, Stooges, Dolls, Roxy, Ramones etc…etc…all fulfilled this task with gusto. Strangely enough, the most influential group ever didn’t quite pull it off.<br>     <br>Much of The Beatles first outing settles for audience-pleasing ploys and attempts at the dried and dusted old-school songwriting techniques that they are ever associated with overturning. <em class=""rymfmt"">“Ask Me Why”</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">“P.S. I Love You”</em> are fascinating, trad examples of textbook Tin Pan Alley Pop-Lite (all ""You"", ""True"", ""Blue"" internal rhymes with cutesy diminished chords) and have none of the rebel fervour that one might expect from the debut of a group that ‘changed the world’. World changing song-craft <em class=""rymfmt"">is</em> supplied by <em class=""rymfmt"">“I Saw Her Standing There”</em> which brilliantly propels the sly, sexual voyeurism of similar <a title=""[Artist477]"" href=""/artist/chuck-berry"" class=""artist"">Chuck Berry</a> or <a title=""[Artist4167]"" href=""/artist/little_richard"" class=""artist"">Little Richard</a> vignettes into the mod-beat-future. Similarly, <em class=""rymfmt"">“There’s A Place”</em> single-handedly sets the template for beat group excellence to this day. Drawing on the ‘Chin up, things will get better’ sentiment employed six years previously to perfection in <em class=""rymfmt"">“Somewhere”</em> from <a title=""[Artist19031]"" href=""/artist/leonard-bernstein"" class=""artist"">Leonard Bernstein</a> &amp; <a title=""[Artist35351]"" href=""/artist/stephen-sondheim"" class=""artist"">Stephen Sondheim</a>’s masterful <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album28061]"" href=""/release/album/various-artists/west-side-story-3/"" class=""album"">West Side Story</a></em> score, the Beatles tune delivers an equal ache of longing but in a vibrantly new beat setting.<br>     <br>Aside from these two songs, there is only the brilliant existential simplicity of <em class=""rymfmt"">“Love Me Do”</em> that hints at the genius to come. Even the title track, despite its feverish exitement, remains the most dated Beatles hit. The other two originals are hack-work that the shady denizons of Tin Pan Alley would hustle to managers of the likes of <a title=""[Artist13368]"" href=""/artist/cliff-richard"" class=""artist"">Cliff Richard</a> and <a title=""[Artist20088]"" href=""/artist/helen_shapiro"" class=""artist"">Helen Shapiro</a>. Sharing a tour bus with the latter, <em class=""rymfmt"">“Misery”</em> was knocked off in a spare half-hour and presented to the teen vocalist but immediately rejected by her manager. They might have had better luck with <em class=""rymfmt"">“Do You Want To Know A Secret?”</em>, a moreish, sugar-coated piece of fluff that displays some slick Brill-Building style pop tricks. Tricks firmly entrenched in the Pop past.<br>     <br>The choice and execution of covers do little more than document their apprentice years of nightclub slogging. Playing to drunken, violent German gangsters demanded a repertoire of styles to suit many a down-at-heel emotional requirement. <em class=""rymfmt"">“Boys”</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">“Chains”</em> are pure filler; obvious rock ‘n’ roll and cod-R&amp;B employed to make a ‘joint’ ‘jump’ or ‘sway’ whenever appropriate. <em class=""rymfmt"">“Baby It’s You”</em> features the fledgling <a title=""[Artist2950]"" href=""/artist/burt_bacharach"" class=""artist"">Burt Bacharach</a>’s tasteful chord thought but is again a surefire club ploy, this time to keep couples ‘smooching’. Its content is little more than white Brill-Building R&amp;B approximation. Bona fide soul singer-songwriter <a title=""[Artist26297]"" href=""/artist/arthur-alexander"" class=""artist"">Arthur Alexander</a>’s <em class=""rymfmt"">“Anna”</em> features a lovely Harrison guitar hook and a raw Lennon vocal but not much else. Once more, it’s firmly of its time and The Beatles interpretation is purely ‘professional’. The same can’t be said about their arrangement of <em class=""rymfmt"">“A Taste Of Honey”</em>. The treatment here is inspired, shiny and gleaming new but with its folky romantic bent, this gorgeous tune was not world changing material to start with. Neither was the most famous Beatle cover, <em class=""rymfmt"">“Twist And Shout”</em>, but it masterfully  reveals the unique, infectious ‘character’ of the group. What <a title=""[Artist203905]"" href=""/artist/brian_epstein"" class=""artist"">Brian Epstein</a> was first ""bowled over"" by. Their “personal charm”. <br>     <br>It seems that a musical ‘phenomenon’ is never down to the music alone. I suggest that The Beatles initial success can be attributed as much to their forward-brushed hair, their pointy boots, their provincial accents and sullen wit (which chimed perfectly with zeitgeist class rebellion) as their music.</span>,<span>The Beatles released such a vast output of outstanding material in the mid to late sixties that their earlier albums are often overlooked and even a little unappreciated.  <br>It all had to start somewhere, and this is where the dream began. It’s hard to imagine a time when Lennon and McCartney had not yet bloomed into proficient songwriters but this was that time, and so there are a lot of covers here. Some are low-key and a little forgettable (A Taste of Honey for example), whereas ‘P.S. I Love You’ is sung beautifully by Paul while John’s definitive version of ‘Twist And Shout’ is utterly breathtaking.<br><br>There are also original compositions too of course. Opening track <br>‘I Saw Her Standing There’ is introduced with a rough and ready <br>“1 2 3 4” and what follows is raw, fresh and pure rock n’ Roll. ‘Please Please Me’ and ‘Love Me Do’ illustrates that even at this early stage they had a depth and versatility beyond their young years. The lyrics are basic and tell simple stories of boy loves girl, but the vocals are excellent, the harmonica gives them an affecting feel and as a result these are songs that have stood the test of time and are still considered to be Beatles classics.  <br><br>The overall production lets the album down a bit but this is a reflection of the times and in a way should be rejoiced as such for records will never sound like this ever again. It literally transports you back to 1963, to the sound that would launch a thousand bands, a time where four young Liverpudlians recorded an album in twenty-four hours and never looked back. <br><br>Essential track: Twist And Shout (for that throat shredding performance)</span>,<span>The problem/challenge with rating a Beatles record is trying to remove the mystique and rate just the record. It's difficult to remain objective, because their music has become the soundtrack of the past 45 years (give or take).<br><br>So, what about the album, their first? The musicianship is primitive, yet catchy. The songwriting is uneven. For every classic like <em class=""rymfmt"">I Saw Her Standing There</em> their's something forgettable like <em class=""rymfmt"">Misery</em>. But the package, somehow, works. Perhaps the amazing thing is that so many of these songs HAVE stood the test of time. Already they are playing with different styles and a different sound than the typical 1963 band. <br><br>So, perhaps I cannot remove the album from the reputation. What the hey, I still like it.</span>,<span>Well, I guess it’s my turn to join the ‘rate your Beatles’ club. Their first work is... well, pretty average, it has “Please Please Me”, “Love Me Do” and “Twist and Shout” to sing along with and of course those ooh-baby-I-love-you lyrics. A surprising thing is that Lennon/McCarthy compositions beat the covers 20 to 0. At times fun to listen, but doesn’t stand the test of continuous listening.</span>,<span>Though they were yet to reach the giddy heights of many of there later albums, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is still an outstanding debut album. But of course, it's The Beatles we're talking about here.<br><br>They were already an experienced band by this stage, after touring Britain and working the seedy bars of Hamburg. I would imagine many of today's poser bands would struggle in front of those audiences of drunk sailors and German prostitutes. <br><br>So despite a pretty lean production this album, it still rocks. ""Twist and Shout"" showed that could already cover songs better than the original artist.<br><br>All the songs here reflect an innocence and joy that is so rare to find in our more cynical, world-weary times. And the Beatles were just lifting off.</span>,<span><em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> is easily the best of the Beatles' 1963 albums, before the Fab Four reached their most creative period.  Even if some of the Lennon/McCartney originals here seem to be overly simple pop songs by today's standard, they were quite impressively crafted for the time and hit their mark precisely.  ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" and the title track still bring a smile to my face as do all but a couple of these tunes.  One of the songs that doesn't measure up is ""Love Me Do"".  I've never been a fan of that song which takes the simplistic approach to an extreme.<br><br>As should be the case with any good album, the first and last songs on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> are absolute gems.  The opener ""I Saw Her Standing There"" is a great party tune and is the best of the early Lennon/McCartney penned singles.  The performance matches the song, showcasing the young Beatles at the top of their game.  Likewise, the version of ""Twist and Shout"" that ends the album is definitive.  It's just about the best song for dancing I can think of...at least for someone of my generation.</span>,<span>I decided to write a review for this album after looking at the Beatles discography and seeing all their albums being at least 4 stars. I'm a Beatles fan, having this album rated that high is excessive. Maybe for 1963 its way above anything else - i wouldn't know I don't have any albums from that period except this. Really on this record there are four great tracks  ""I Saw Her Standing There"",<br>""Anna"", ""PS I Love You"" and ""Twist and Shout"". Two of which are covers. Everything else is solid or quite poor eg ""There's a Place"", or ""A Taste of Honey"". Their popularity obviously gives this a huge rating, but really its nothing spectacular. It wasn't till the <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> that they produced a top notch album.</span>,<span>With ""A 1,2,3,4,"" history was made with the exciting opening number, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" from Please Please Me, the debut album of the best group the world has had the pleasure to experience.<br><br>""Misery"" has the rhythm guitar that became part of the Beatles' signature style. At least in the early days. <br><br>""Anna (Go To Him)"" is an archetypal 60's type ballad originally done by R&amp;B singer Arthur Alexander.  I've always said that The Beatles were the greatest Rock &amp; Roll band ever, and the Greatest R &amp; B Band ever! <br><br>Their rendition of the Cookies' ""Chains"" shows they do justice to the works one of America's best songwriters, Carole King and Louise Goffin.<br><br>""Boys"" is classic rollicking rock and roll and sung by Ringo, and one of two Shirelles numbers done here--the other is the slow and languid ""Baby It's You,"" the song beginning with ""Sha la la la la la la.""<br><br>The centerpiece of this album is the title track, which became the Beatles' first #1 hit on the British charts--it only reached #3 in the U.S. Anyone who wonders why the Beatles made it big need only hear this song. Love that harmonica in between the verses!<br><br>The ""Love Me Do"" version here is not the originally recorded single version which reached #17 on the British charts and #1 on the Billboard Singles Chart. Rather, this has Andy White on drums while Ringo is relegated to tapping a tambourine. For the version that hit the single charts, get Past Masters Volume I. I like both versions all the same.<br><br>""P.S. I Love You"" is sung by Paul and is the first song on where he sings solo--he sings with John on the previous songs. The other song where he sings solo is on the ballad ""A Taste Of Honey,"" singing of honey ""tasting much sweeter than wine.""<br><br>It's George's turn to sing lead on ""Do You Want To Know A Secret."" The backing vocals after the second verse provide a nice touch.<br><br>Two rollicking numbers signal the close of Please Please Me, both sung by John. They are ""There's A Place"" and the definitive rendition of the Isley Brothers' ""Twist And Shout."" I wonder how long it took John's vocals to recover after nearly singing himself to shreds.<br><br>Many artists would not have come to be without the Beatles, and we have this album to thank for.</span>"
"<span>What bullshit I have heard about the early Beatles. Others say they played sissy music, others that they only played pop music (like they know what that means), and others say that they were plain crap. I repeat. Total BULLSHIT. <em class=""rymfmt"">Please please me</em> is an instant classic and one of the best Rock 'n' Roll albums I have ever heard. The fab four (especially John &amp; Paul) are at their best as they expand their blues, r 'n' b and rock 'n' roll influences. So what if the used pop elements to achieve commercial success. They were great at it and recorded classic songs from the beginning with ""I saw her standing there"", a great rocker to start off the album, to the exploding finish with ""Twist and shout"", one of the best cover songs ever. The hits ""Please please me"" and ""Love me do"" are historic songs as well, the later being the first ever single to be released by the band. But you can find other great songs in this album also, such as ""Do you want to know a secret?"" and ""Misery"", while the cover songs work well too. All in all, this is one hell of an album, which will definitely entertain you and should be respected by all music lovers. I agree that it does not have the artistic value of their later works, but nevertheless in this album the Beatles prove why they became such a huge phenomenon.<br><br>19/20</span>,<span>If we say The Beatles is the beginer of all things{of course its not},the all bands that live after them {Backstairs Or Deictic},take influence from the beatles.<br>They Use a Rhytm guitar,a Lead guitar,a Bass and a Drums that is the basic structure in bands that live after them.<br>They begin with rock and roll that in it sounds of guitars and basses was louder that past...the structure that they used in their songs thereafter was the basic structure of rock style.Donnybrooks and loud shoutings,harmony vocals,hand-claps and solo guitars in rock and roll songs was in their Music's caharacteristics and thereinto tehe time of their musics was about 2 minutes.<br>Using short beauty piano parts,Paul McCartney and John Lennon's love Songs,and play the other artist's songs were assignable in their first works.<br>Other aposematic about them is that their music was more important than their words,as they versatility adjust words with music like Ask Me Why.<br>How beit Paul and John were the lead vocalist of band but all members had sing in the songs.<br>using Acoustic Guitars and mixing were a few assignable in their first works.<br>14 songs in one album,often love lyrical.composers of band were John Lennon and then Paul Mccartney.John's songs were dreamy and lovely but it was assignable that he pay attention to beauty music more that words,as sometimes he repeat the words or use some inept in songs.{but his words in lyrics were very beautyfull}<br>But Paul's songs were much rock &amp; roll.he often used new instruments and like to sing in his songs.he recorded ""Love Me do"" in two versions that second version recorded a week next...and tambourine had used in it.<br>the common work of Paul and John Was ""Misery"" that both of them were lead singer on that song.the other song were writen by the others like Arthur Alexander,Gerry Goffin/Carole King,Luther Dixon/Wes Farrell,Mack David/Bert Bacharach/Barney Williams,Author,Ric Marlow/Bobby Scott,Bert Russell/Phil Medley.<br>John Actually Was Played Rhytm Guitar,He did his work perfectly and easily could sing or play harmonica when he was played guitar,he was very important and necessary and he was the only one who play rhytm guitar in the beatles and was more important than he showed.at second he was a lead vocalist,he had a powerfully voice but he did not use it always.he was singing with his own voice and did not chang it.in third he played Harmonica,he played short beauty harmonica parts that often were in intro of songs.in 4th he was a harmony vocalist and background vocalist that helped the  songs to be more beauty.at last he used Hand-claps and electrified acoustic guitar.<br>but Paul Mccartney,He was actually a bassist and was very necessary.his loud bass sounds made structure songs harder.at second he was a lead vocalist and background vocalist...his voice was louder than John but nobody were not sing in background like him.his loud screams blooming in Rock and Metal genres.his next job was harmony vocals thay helped the songs to be better and then he was a composer.at last he used hand-claps.<br>Geroge was  at first a lead guitarist...his solo guitar parts blooming in rock and metal and became one of most important parts in music.he did his works excellently and influenced by best Guitarists.in second he was a background vocalist with a good voice.and his next job was lead vocals and harmony vocals,he had a good voice too.and at last he used hand-claps,Acoustic Guitar and Lead Electrified Acoustic Guitar.<br>And Ringo Starr,Of Course He Was a Drummer...He did his job Good...He was a real Rock&amp;Roll Drummer.He did play lead vocal,tambourine,maracas and background vocal too.<br>2 guests George Martin and Andy White Helped the band too...George Martin Played Beauty short Piano Parts in two songs...and Andy White Played Drums in two songs when Ringo played maracas Or  tambourine...<br>in this album bass guitar,drums and lead vocals were most important instruments,at second Rhytm guitar and background Vocals rode on album...Paul,Ringo,John,Geoge did It perfectly...Lead Guitar at third was important that George Harrison played that...Harmony Vocals at 4th,Harmonica at 5th,Hand-claps at 6th,Piano at 7th and electrified acoustic guitar,acoustic guitar,lead electrified acoustic guitar,tambourine,maracas at last.</span>,<span>you can dis-regard this album from anything of substance that the beatles did...it's merely bad generic pop music,most of which are covers...avoid p.s. i love you like the plague.</span>,<span>This is a Johnny Boy review<br><br>Here it is, the first Beatles LP and where the group's songwriting genius was first sown. This is album is a very good example of a pop record (though not perfect - that title would go to the 'A Hard Days Night' LP later on). Granted, half of the album is full of covers but most albums were back then and it doesn't matter as the Beatles take these covers and make them their own. The Beatles sound comfortable playing covers (this is probably due to the time they spent gigging in Hamburg), tracks like Burt Bacharach's 'Baby It's You' and 'Anna Go To Him' being great little tunes. But the best cover on the album is defnitely their exciting rendition of 'Twist and Shout' - complete with John Lennon's rasping vocals, the Beatles have managed to ram this song into the public conciousness, providing a cover that is better than the original. The boys are also on top songwriting form - the album kicks off with the rocking McCartney number 'I Saw Her Standing There', a track brimming with sexual excitement, and he is also responsible for their first single 'Love Me Do'. Once again, Lennon works his genius - 'Please Please Me' is one of the greatest pop tunes of all time 'There's a Place' is a great tune (even if it is dismissed by many as a throwaway track). Now and again, the album does get a bit overtly sentimental (McCartney's slightly silly 'P.S. I Love You) but it isn't enough to affect the quality of the album. With this LP, the Beatles kicked off a fantastic career with style.</span>,<span>Well, I see why in some polls this has a better position than its follower, <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles.</em> The production on this album is sharper. There is some energy here left that is missing from the second album. I don't mean that the songs are 'rocking' – it is everywhere, also in the ballad-type songs. Let's have an example: ""P.S. I Love You."" Not a lesson in virtuosity, not one of the most memorable Beatle compositions. But somehow the guys and George Martin make it sound good. The vocal arrangement works – Paul even sings a blue note once or twice – and the sound is as nature intended, which often means 'beautiful.' Well, lots of useless covers here – actually, the best tracks of the two first albums would make one <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> level album together.</span>,<span>This was the Beatles live set from the early days committed to record in the studio. Put in the context of all their later work then this album is seriously sub-standard, but put up against any of the albums released in early 1963, then this is one of the most amazing albums of the year. Although there were 2 singles featured on the album, namely ""Love Me Do"" and ""Please Please Me"", you will surely know the lots of the other songs well, such as ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""Twist &amp; Shout"". The Beatles were setting the standard for a new genre of music, namely Beat Music, and of the Beat music albums released in 63-64, then this one stands head and shoulders above the competition. For a Beatles album, its a starter and a sign of greater things to come, but as a period piece set in 1963, then it was the perhaps the greatest album to date.</span>,<span>Call it what it is.  A fine record by what will eventually become the greatest band of all time.  Too many covers but leaps and bounds above anything else at the time.   With hindsight, its easy to say this is a good record, not a great one though.</span>,<span>despite being mostly cover songs, i enjoy listening to this early beatle album. much fun.</span>"
"<span>There was so much better to come... Some highlights though, including the breakthrough ""Love Me Do"", the rock n roll ""I Saw Her Standing There"", all the way to ""Twist and Shout"", all recorded in one marathon 6-hour session.</span>,<span>Although it feels a sin giving three stars to beatles album, i have to face facts... half of it is covers, anyway :)</span>,<span>Buen debut de los beatles, aunque bastante lejos de sus grandes obras. Músicalmente no es nada del otro mundo, demostrando que les quedaba mucho por aprender, pero muestra un desparpajo y frescura notables...Destacan: ""I saw her standing there"" , ""ask me why"", ""please please me"", ""love me do"", ""Do you want to know a secret"" o los covers ""ana"" y ""twist and shout"".</span>,<span>While only a few of the tracks stood out to me as being exceptionally good (I Saw Her Standing There, Anna, Twist and Shout)collectivly the album is a brilliant piece of pop rock, laying a foundation for their brilliant catalog.  Remarkable harmonizing throughout the album among the 4 members.</span>,<span>Excellent debut, choc-full-of melodies and harmonies to die for. Shame they didn't have more confidence to replace some of the cover versions with the excellent tracks already in their live shows at the time like ""One after 909"". Still, it was the beginning of, well, the beginning of music as we now know it and it's a thoroughly enjoyable record, albeit a tad basic.</span>,<span>Bubblegummy pop, but it's still good. Basically, while it's still good music, it's not why I love the Beatles, and it's not what made them a timeless band. <br><br>Good debut album though</span>,<span>simply put: recorded in 13 hours, this album serves as an indicator as to what the world was about to experince. Their harmonies are simply amazing and their melodies are out of this world!!</span>,<span>The beginning of the band that made modern music the way it is today. Weather you like The Beatles or not, this is an album that you MUST appreciate. From the beginning, (with the excellent song ""I Saw Her Standing There"") an impression is made, and it is easy to see how Britain fell in love with the Beatles so quickly. From<em> Please Please Me </em>, the path was laid for the Beatles to change the world forever. Excellent vocals from all Fab Four on this album.</span>"
"<span>A fine debut but a little bit dated. Far more anyway than most of their later recordings. But significant in the history of popmusic.<br><br>(Home rating: 73,5)</span>,<span>'Twist and Shout' still brings a shiver to my spine.</span>,<span>Charming, but mediocre debut from the greatest band in the world.<br><br>The band's enthusiastic, the arrangements are solid and the playing's good, but some of the material here seems obsolete, and soon gets boring. But, it's not a bad effort, and worth checking out just because it was here it all started.</span>,<span>As a debut, ""Please Please Me"" is really strong, and might have been the strongest album ever at the time of its release.<br><br>In retrospect, the large number of cover versions makes it somewhat patchy, but the originals by Lennon and McCartney are all really strong songs that must have sounded completely different from anything else that existed at the time. <br><br>The oldest pop album worth listening to.</span>,<span>This is, without a doubt, The Beatles' worst album. It's atrocious bubblegum pop, and I can barely stand to listen to it. The Beatles didn't start to get good until the release of<em> Rubber Soul.</em> There isn't much to say about this album. There were too many covers (there's no excuse for that many covers on one album in my opinion), the lyrics are extremely bland and generic, and even the instrument-playing doesn't sound all that good. I usually avoid Beatles music made before 1966...I just go straight past that and look toward real musical artistry and experimentation. It has a few nice catchy tunes like ""Do You Want to Know a Secret,"" but overall, the tunes are extremely repetitive pop. Please, spare yourself the pain knowing The Beatles made something like this and buy<em> The White Album </em>instead. (2.5/10)</span>,<span>The Beatles debut is historically significant beat pop, certainly, and whilst it captures a lot of their early energy and developing writing genius, it also contains a fair amount of filler in the form of several average cover versions (the exception being the awesome performance of ""Twist and Shout"").</span>,<span>I got all excited when I found out what a rare album this is.  Then I discovered that my copy was an unauthorized version that is virtually worthless.  Oh, well...it's still a great album.</span>,<span>This captures The Beatles while they were at the height of their powers as a live band and the sheer energy just pours out of the grooves. No matter what you think of their later recordings, there's no doubt that the lack of touring took the edge off their playing. Even the next few albums made before their stage retirement suffer because of their live shows becoming personal appearances rather than real performances. <br><br>OK, so some of the songs here are a bit cheesy, but the sheer vibrancy of the singing and playing more than compensate. So you can hang up your<em> Revolver </em>and forget that walk down the<em> Abbey Road </em>- this, for me, is the sound of The Beatles.</span>"
"<span>A review of the Beatles first album on their own, released on the Emi labels (then) very little branch named, Parlophone (which would later in the 90´s be the record base for the magnificent Supergrass)<br><br>This album is of course and will perhaps always be looked upon as that<em> legendary album </em>that was recorded so fast.<br>However dear readers, what I would want to bring forth here is that, this does not however make it a magnificent album. I’m not saying that an album cannot be made in one or two days... McCartney later did this for his<em> soviet </em>LP in the 80´s and it was a magnificent rock n roll punch.<br><br>This recording however is not a glimpse at the Beatles in a direct swinginly down to the bone rock n roll experiences, and it’s not the start of rock n roll history either, either for the Beatles, nor anyone else <br><br>However there are some pretty swinging moments, and it keeps a quite good all-round level, although, I could never consider this as the same direct, rock n roll glimpse that was so neatly captured, on the polydor recordings for Keampfert, where he captured them with no hazzle<br>This is George martin however, cutting a pop and pep record by guys in neat suits, and it quite all right I guess.<br><br>Ringo is a newcomer on this album on drums, was never really my style though, he always seems to try to splash and crash more or do something that is not at all as jammy <br>as Pete’s jamming<br><br>Other than that it’s the regular Beatle line up with George on lead guitar (which he is great at) John on harmonica (which is in fact rather groovy at) &amp; rhythm guitar (which he is, not that good but a bit jammy at) and Paul on bass Guitar (well, well) <br><br>It kicks of with I Saw her standing there a rather good tune in fact, that features Paul on lead and is a good opening performance for an album, its straight forward, and no hassle which is good, its just that it perhaps doesn’t have the jammin edge that it could have had. (note: was also attempted in a “in the rough take by Finland rockabilly rollers “the Hurriganes” in rather amusing fashion, at a much later date) <br> <br>We all know that Lennon and McCartney (or McCartney/Lennon as they are credited on this album.) had an obvious flare and a talent to write songs. And of course the majority of their songs here include, all the ingredients, songs usually are due to include, and they are well listenable and all. But not all of them are that exciting, but then again there are no skippers either. (Why wasn’t Like dreamers do included on this, or why wasn’t some more space given to George, who had previously penned the magnificent “cry for a shadow “)<br><br><br>There are also some jamming covers included, which is nice. Baby  its you is a nice swingin ballad( in the same veins of a earlier track of the disc,<em> Anna </em>with both good backing vocals and a nice delivered lead vocal. The actual rhythm of the song is quite groovy too, and it might seem a bit boring at times it’s catchy and well done.    <br><br>I personally think that the albums actual high point may be the Paul McCartney delivered, the waltz and twist driven rather folksy edged rock n roll ballad<em> A Taste of Honey </em>which is features some fine picking and fine backing too, its swings on so too speak in its mellow little mood.<br>The albums title track please please me is a good one too nice good direct rock n roll swing thing with tight backing, and is far more exciting, and more driven, than the perhaps more commercially famous “love me do”(which exists in three versions with this being a thigh pop take which is well done but boring compared to the EMI 1962 Audition track in a more jammy  bluesy rough manner, with Pete Best on drums.. however this song in general, regardless of its three versions with three different drummers is not really that amazing in any case, but its catchy, perhaps that’s why it got number 1.)<br><br>I think misery form Lennon, originally written for Cilla black, is an underrated little swingin number with interesting melody, that starts of slow. <br>I consider that john got way much raving about from everyone for his delivering of Twist and Shout which is not really THAT amazing, although a good swinging track his voice is not that fulfilling, I think. (The searchers would record this song for their debut as well, and it’s more of my taste).<br><br>Harrison gets a solo vocal spot in<em> do you want to know a secret </em>and it’s a fine number, a swingin, yet a bit sombre twisting number with some catchy backing, (however its need to be said that Billy J Kramer’s reading of this song, despite the lack  of sombre feel and catchy backing, he was the one that got it really twisting.)<br><br>Well I could keep on mentioning these songs track by track but I don’t really see the point since the songs very much keep the same level (more or less.)<br><br>Well yeah I would like to put in a vote for ask me why being a fine little tune, although I still consider the BBC cut from June 62 with Pete at the seat, had more direct swing to it.<br><br>And in fact Ringo´s number is quite good on this, although I don’t have a great passion for Ringo as a drummer nor as a singer, his deliverance of the rock n roll standard “boys” is a pretty good swingin romp in the veins of (very much) ray Charles “what I’d Say”<br>It features some amusing backing too.<br><br>All in all this is an album rated three, and its not because of the lack of Lennon and McCartney tunes(heh its rather the opposite) it’s an okay easy listenable album that perhaps shouldn’t be overlooked but not overrated either. And as for this being a significant album for its fast recording in one or two days, all I have to say is that so was the Beatles Polydor recordings, they where not as many, and not issued as a full-length album. But to me they were finer testaments of the Beatles at a rock n roll peak.<br>This album is rather well done, but more of a well done trendsetter than a well done Rock n Roll record  <br>  <br>  <br>the title track is pretty neat though</span>,<span>Like all Beatles albums, there's only a few good songs if you are lucky.<br><br>I saw here standing there<br>Love me do<br>Twist and shout<br><br>Are good songs.</span>,<span>Wow, the first Beatles album. I really don't know what to say. Even people who love the Beatles and happily acknowledge them as the greatest band ever think that their early work was just TOO early to really enjoy, but I don't see why. Soon after it was released (actually, with the release of their first single), the Beatles were immediately swept up in attention, and this captures the good-natured, clean cut sound they were famous for at the time. There's some rockabilly, R+B, girl group, and ballad work here, showing how eclectic they were from the start. Yeah, what's here is a little dated (how could it not be?) but it's a fun and compulsive listen, not just a historical document. In my opinion, ANY compilation attempting to comprehensively cover the Beatles work is incomplete without ""I Saw her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", and of course, the most famous single take of all time, ""Twist and Shout"". The band had one afternoon to record the album, and John's voice was completely shot by the end of the day. Still, they knocked out the cover and it became one of their biggest early hits. Such a great song to sing along to. There are some lesser tracks here too, but you blink and they're gone either way, which makes it perfect for repeated listenings.</span>,<span>It's still fresh, and has the amazing final ""Twist &amp; Shout"" on it with ill throated john Lennon on lead vocals. ""I Saw Her standing There"" is still one best rock 'n roll songs ever written...</span>,<span>The Beatles' debut<em> Please Please Me </em>is very impressive given the period that it was recorded in.  While other bands that would later go on to show their brilliance recorded extremely spotty albums (*cough* The Beach Boys *cough), the Beatles were actually releasing well crafted and highly enjoyable albums (not just singles).  Most of the album is excellent (""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Misery"", ""Ask Me Why"", ""Please Please Me"" and ""Twist and Shout"" being particularly memorable) with the exception of a few boring covers (""Chains"", ""Boys"", ""A Taste of Honey"", and a few others).<br><br>It's unbelievable that even this early the Beatles would outshine all the competition.  This is not a historical document, merely for the rabid collector, but a living piece of music. <em> Please Please Me </em>may have been recorded by a rough and tumble Hamburg strip club house band, but it captures the innocence and exuberance of its period with crystalline clarity.</span>,<span>The quickly recorded debut of The Beatles,<em> Please Please Me </em>is them in the most primitive form. And for the better or worse, depending on your view. For me, I'd say worse, because the music is rather amateurish and childish. I can't help but like the title track, ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and the hit ""Love Me Do"", however, but the rest is not as memorable. Still, you won't go far wrong with this, just don't expect anything like<em> Abbey Road.</em></span>,<span>I Saw Her Standing There and Twist &amp; Shout stand head and shoulders above anything else here, including the singles.</span>,<span>not quite as good as i thought it would be, but i figured it was something i needed. if nothing else, it's fun. just nowhere near the quality of<em> rubber soul.</em><br><br>""do you want to know a secret"" is still one of my all-time favorite oldies, and i do believe that this version of ""twist and shout"" is not only the definitive version, but also one of the beatles' most successful vocal performances.</span>"
"<span>I like this album, no matter what anyone else says.  It's nice and simple, and it even rocks hard in some places.  You've got a lot of Lennon/McCartney's first successful compositions in ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Love Me Do"" and ""Please Please Me.""  Not only is it revealing of their songwriting stages, but it also gives a good look at what their live act was at the time; the album was recorded in on straight session, in about twelve hours.  There's raw energy in songs like ""Boys,"" ""Please Please Me,"" and ""Twist and Shout.""  True, it is probably the Beatles worst album, but it's far from even remotely being bad!!!  <br><br>Highlights include ""I Saw Her Standing There,"" ""Please Please Me,"" ""Love Me Do,"" ""There's a Place,"" and ""Twist and Shout.""</span>,<span>Looking at this 40 years later, many of us don't consider it a classic. After all,<em> Revolver,</em><em> Rubber Soul,</em><em> The White Album,</em><em> Sgt. Pepper </em>and<em> Abbey Road </em>seem so much more complex. I think, however, that when put in its historical place, we'd have to say this is one of the most important and original records ever released. How can it be original with 6 cover songs? All the cover songs are better produced and more simply and elegantly played than the originals and just end up being better songs. They showed you don't have to have a traditionally beautiful voice to sing rock and roll. Just listen to any rock and roll record that came out before this and then listen to this. It is head and shoulders better. Reviewing it from today's perspective is so hard because so many bands have taken what the Beatles started with this record and done so much wonderful stuff with the genre, but the family tree of almost any record released to day has this down near the trunk. All the songs are pleasant and easy to like, that's never a negative in my book either.</span>,<span>Judging by the interest in the Beatles these days, it's hard to believe it's been over 30 years since the band split up, and over 20 years since John Lennon was murdered. With a recent album, TV special, Book, and Website, these guys are busier than most bands that are still active in the industry.<br><br>The Beatles tend to go in and out of vogue every few years, correct that, the Beatles, it seems, are never out of style, just some years they are more in style than other years. They are such a huge part of pop culture it's easy to overlook the fact that a little over 40 years ago, they were just four turks from Liverpool trying to get noticed playing music.<br><br>Everyone knows their story. From Liverpool to Hamburg to the Cavern club, to Brian Epstein to EMI and George Martin. From Pete Best to Ringo Starr on the brink of fame (""the greatest 'bit part' ever written""). The band was hustled into the studio to pump out a full length album to add to sales of their first #1 single ""Please Please Me"". The album, legend tells us, was recorded in one day, with 8 originals, and 6 covers.<br><br>It's interesting how some people tend to underestimate the Beatles covers. Everyone talks about how amazing a songwriting team Lennon and McCartney were, and how you throw in a good songwriter like George Harrison, and you have an epic songwriting music machine. They praise the band's vocal arrangements, for setting a standard by which all others will be forever judged. They mention how, with the fab four, the album became a complete artistic statement instead of merely a collection of songs.<br><br>But people tend to downplay the Beatles covers. It's easy when you're discussing the brilliance and cultural impact of Sgt. Pepper, The White Album, Abbey Road, etc., to forget that in their early years, the Beatles did lots of covers. Their first four albums are full of them. ""A Hard Day's Night"" (their 3rd album) is the only all original album of the first four by the fab four.<br><br>Does that mean those albums are any less brilliant? I don't think so. The term Beatlemania was coined in 1963, based on fan reaction to the band and their first two albums. Unpolished though they may be, the Beatles early work shows a band of remarkable maturity, despite the fact none of the members had reached their 23rd birthday at the time of the release of the debut album.<br><br>Of the 8 originals, 3 are what would be considered Beatles classics. ""I Saw Her Standing There"", with the rockin' kickoff ""1,2,3,4!..."" is as strong an opening track as any of their albums has to offer. ""Love Me Do"" is famous for John's harmonica, and the fact that it was their first single, but it's in fact one of the weakest singles they would ever release. The same can't be said of ""Please Please Me"". The song structure, lyrics, vocal arrangement, and powerhouse ending are a stunning achievement, and a signal of the brilliance that was to come.<br><br>Of the other originals, the best is ""There's a Place"", a song that would be a single for most artists. ""Misery"", ""PS I Love You"", and ""Do you want to know a Secret""(with George singing) are all strong tracks.<br><br>One of the signs of a great artist is what they can do with other people's material, and the Beatles always shined at this. It's been said that a good artist copies, a great artist steals. You ask the average person, who wrote ""Twist and Shout"", and 99% will say the Beatles. The Isley Brothers might have done it first, but the Beatles made it their own.<br><br>The vocal arrangement, and passion displayed on ""Baby it's You"" makes you forget it was done by a girl group first. The energy on ""Boys"" (featuring Ringo) and ""Chains"", are proof enough that these tracks are not mere ""filler"". Even ""Anna"" and ""A Taste of Honey"", while maybe not the strongest selections, still maintain a freshness that carries across the whole album.<br><br>If a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, ""Please Please Me"" represents one small step for the Beatles, and one giant leap for popular music.</span>,<span>At the time of recording the<em> Please Please Me </em>album in early 1963, the Beatles previously had a minor hit (""Love Me Do"") and a big hit (""Please Please Me"") in the UK to their credit.<br>It's hard to believe that what was basically still just a bar band with little studio experience,     would put in one day of work with George Martin at Abbey Road and create a near great album that would spark Beatlemania in the UK. A little ragged around the edges in spots, but plenty of great stuff to go around.<br>Some classic early Lennon-McCartney: ""I Saw her Standing There"", ""Please Please Me"", ""There's A Place"" and ""Do You Want To Know A Secret"".<br>There is no doubt that the Fabs had a sack full of cover songs from their live act to choose from at the time and of the six presented here the highlights are ""Twist And Shout"" and ""Anna (Go To Him)"", both featuring fantastic vocal performances from John Lennon.<br>A solid first album. And yes, ""they passed the audition""</span>,<span>poor by beatles standards.  songs like ""chains"" not very good.  too many covers... and some of the originals were by the #s... that being said ""i saw her standing there"" and ""twist &amp; shout"" the opener/closers alone make it a good album.  ""please please me"" a great early single.  ""love me do"" a not so great one... i've also always really liked ""anna"" even though it's a very cheesey song.  not an album i have listened to in a long time... as an album it's poor to average - but there are some good tracks.</span>,<span>The first and worst.  A worst for the Beatles is still a fantastic album, especially for the era.  If the beatles were killed in a place crash after its release it would be rated a classic groundbreaking album.  It's not up to the standard of the later albums but what is? fav track on album - Please Please Me.</span>,<span><em>Please Please me,</em><em> With the Beatles,</em> and<em> Beatles for Sale </em>could be thought of as a three part album. If you're looking to find out why the group is the greatest band ever, this isn't the area of their history you want to check out. But, if you want to invite a great 60's club band into your living room for a half hour,<em> Please Please Me </em>is what the doctor ordered. The music is of limited style, but it's all executed perfectly and has the charm of the period.</span>,<span>A good album, but hindered with 12 Bar backgrounds.</span>"
"<span>This is a remarcable collection of songs. While track A1 both defines and closes the genre of Merseybeat, it is almost topped by the next idiosyncratic track that I really did not know what to make of the first time I heard it as an 11 year old boy with rudimenary knowledge in english language and culture, and that 25 years later bemuses me in a similar way. A6, A7 and B6 are pure gold and together with A2 it sets the record apart from anything produced at the time. Lennon’s voice on B7 puts the tracks in a proud sequence of songs leading right into the druggy garagy heart of the second half of the 60s. B3 is, with its intelligent early 60s lyrics, unique among Beatles tracks and shows Lennon as a singer at his best (just listen to ”over youhuhuh”), and the mix of idiosyncratic music composing and audience courtship on B2 results in a track worth listening to at least once in a while. A5 is usually dismissed as a throwaway, but seriously, how many recordings from the early 60s, or any period, could match it? Just compare it to the dull output of contemporary beat groups. If you appreciate ”good bad” singing (and a good bad performances in general), this is a gem.<br><br>Five tracks, of less interest, remain. One of these (B5) is even somewhat annoying, and as a result, this is not at all a perfect record. However, it is actually well-composed, setting off with a count-in and a rocker, and ending with two strong tracks. I also love the transition from A6 to A7.</span>,<span>This album was a great debut for a great band, but better things would come. This album sounded very uninspired, to me.<br>Stand-Outs: 'Please Please Me', and 'I Saw Her Standing There'</span>,<span>This album opens brilliantly with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" and has a number of their early classics like ""Please Please Me"", ""Love Me Do"" and ""P.S. I Love You"" - excellent pop numbers. Their other compositions are great pop songs too, and the covers are pretty good for the most part. Some of it sounds a bit dated now, but in the Great Scheme Of Things this is a classic album. 5 *s</span>,<span>The Debut Album of the best band ever is a one of their best cds at the early times of beatles career which is only 7 years 1963-1970.<br>The originals are rock n roll masterpieces like Please Please Me, Love Me Do, I Saw Her Standing There, Do You Want To Know A Secret and PS I Love You the rest of the originals are great and the covers are marvelous especially Twist and Shout.<br>NOTHING HERE IS BAD<br>Best beatle here - John Lennon</span>,<span>The First Beatles Album<br>Well Well Well<br>Here are my thoughts<br>The album kicks off nicely with I Saw Her Standing There it immediately gives you the 'smile' that you get when a beatles album starts u know.<br>The rest of the originals are RnR masterpieces and the Covers are amazing especially Twist And Shout but except fot A Taste Of Honey</span>,<span>Debut album by mop-topped foursome from England. Knocked out in a day. World replies: ""Holy Shit""</span>,<span>The start of something special the world would soon come to embrace</span>,<span>A stunning debut with a raucous and spontaneous feel. Probably not their best album but perhaps their most exciting. More passion and enthusiasm evident here than anywhere else - from the opening count-off of Paul's ""I Saw Her Standing There"" to the raspy-throated shout of John on the concluding cover of ""Twist and Shout"". They never let up whether they are doing originals or their favorites from others. One of their best - and that's saying a lot.</span>"
"<span>Hmm... I don't have this album, but I know the songs, or most of them. Maybe I should not start to rate this, but I can't wait.<br><br>This was just the beginning of their career and they kicked out with ""I Saw Here Standing There""***½, ""Twist And Shout""***** and ""Please Please Me""****½. ""Love Me Do""***½ is OK. ""Boys""*½ sucks. Other songs are something between them. Compared to the masterpieces they made later in their career.<br>Average: 3.20/5 <br><br>I think I might change my rating after hearing the whole album as a one pack.</span>,<span>LOVED IT<br>this album started beatlemania in britain it had 8 originals and 6 covers.<br>I SAW HER STANDING THERE was a great rocker that gave u the feeling it is a live album truly amazing the rest of the album includes HITS like PLEASE PLEASE ME and LOVE ME DO which are both oldies classics and the covers are truly good no low moments here.</span>,<span>An essential Beatles album in the sense that this is where it all began. there is evidence of the john/paul divide, with john's songs being more rock based than pauls. Slight western hint to the album. You can feel the raw simplicity in the tracks, the album being made in a day.<br>An enjoyable experience<br>Woolf</span>,<span>No matter what anyone says, I cannot imagine how<em> With the Beatles </em>could be considered better than<em> Please Please Me.</em><em> Please Please Me </em>contains a preview of things to come during the psychedelic/hippie era of rock when bands would be talking about exploring your mind and such things. The song is called ""There's a Place"" which is one of the best on this album. This album contains classics like the title song, as well as ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Love Me Do"", and ""P.S I Love You"" which should have been the Beatles first single instead of ""Love Me Do"". ""Do You Want to Know a Secret"" is a fun one, and Misery, Anna, and Baby It's You are all emotional but well done tunes. This album seems to have so much more heart and soul than<em> With The Beatles,</em> apart from the cover versions of You've Really Got a Hold on Me, and Roll Over Beethoven, on<em> With.</em></span>,<span>What a feeling of thrown-together spontaneity you get from this record; the capturing of a formative talent and spirit of this new group from Liverpool. Very much of its times, which one can see in the cover versions and <br><br>But this is a new guitar pop; slightly off-key vocals at times, with genuine character. ""Misery"" pleases with its girl-pop influences, yet the atmosphere really kicks in with Lennon's lead, and the skeletal, gently shimmering backing in ""Anna (Go To Him)"". Lovely lead guitar. Effective choice of song to cover. ""Chains"" seems far more by-the-book and straightforward cover; no frills and not the best thing on here, though competent. ""Boys"" again is competent, enjoyable filler; Ringo belting it out for the first time, aided by harmonies. <br>Then: a great run of four Lennon-McCartney originals... ""Ask Me Why""; can't quantify quite why, but this has long been a personal favourite song of mine. ""I can't believe... it's happened to me""; all so sincere, romantic in its beautiful vocal delivery. Very nostalgic sounding, both for when I first heard it (1993/1994 when I was first getting into music) and for the fresh early 1960s that it evokes. ""Please Please Me""... propulsive,<em> key </em>single: wonderfully blatant sexual imploring turned into real euphoria. This is pop magic, through and through. ""Love Me Do"" is far from as spectacular, but thoroughly competent and appealing; that harmonica sets it apart from pop of the time as well. As always on this album, the fresh yet practised voices and musical approaches of the group hold a great charm. ""P.S. I Love You"" is amusingly and sublimely in the mould of the crooning pop of the time. McCartney's vocals are wonderfully plaintive; nice harmonies, and a really nifty little song. The first sign really in their career, of Macca's penchant for using older forms of music to his advantage. Then an interpretation of Bacharach-David's ""Baby It's You""; a bare version obviously, but that gives it an engaging, intimate appeal. Lovely guitar bit on the solo; backed by a glockenspiel? Sounds something like that. <br><br>Then for another<em> personal </em>favourite: ""Do You Want To Know A Secret?"" An entirely winning slice of innocent 60s pop; sublimely plaintive harmonies, and Lennon's touching vocal, with the vigour of his forceful ""_Ahhm_ I'm love with you..."". A beautifully simple and moving song, for me. ""A Taste of Honey"" is perhaps one of the<em> older </em>sounding things here; again, Macca contributes lead vocal. It's always been a song I've liked a bit; no doubt about that, yet not really a highlight.<br><br>Ooh, and again, that harmonica, that announces the stomping, stonking raw pop of ""There's A Place"". It's all so slightly ramshackle and sparse - yet filled with vital, empathic drumming from Ringo. The backing vocals are slightly wayward and this can only add to the thing's appeal. Then, well, the one song on here that seems to be most celebrated these days; Lennon's remarkably powerful rasping through ""Twist and Shout"". <br><br>It exemplifies the appeal of this album. Of course, musicianship's not as developed or experimental as on later records, but this has so much charm and character to it. It's a bracing breath of fresh air; and one that just at the moment, beguiles and interests me more than the over-familiar later work. Like Marcello Carlin once said, this album ""explodes like a freshly opened can of ice-cold Coke on a Saturday morning in August"": a more perfect epitaph than I could come up with.</span>,<span>The 1st Beatles album I ever playd, happens to be their 1st american LP. Album is the U.S version of ""Please Please Me"" which was released in the U.K. on 3/22/63 containing 14 tracks. ""Introducing The Beatles"" released 7/22/63 in the U.S contains 12 total tracks, missing are ""Ask Me Why"" &amp; ""Please Please Me"". On 1/27/64 another ""Introducing The Beatles"" album was released, this album also contained 12 total tracks however, dropped from this version are ""P.S. I Love You"" &amp; ""Love Me Do"" and they were replaced with ""Ask Me Why"" &amp; Please Please Me"". I own the 1963 version and recently discovered I own a very rare album VJ 1062 (1).SC3 there are many veried releases of this album this one is valued at approx $7,000.oo and there are many counterfeits. For more info go to rarebeatles.com or www2.excelr8.net/allowell for excellent info on the american Beatle albums. The Beatles version of ""Twist And Shout"" has to be considered one of the great Rock ""N"" Roll songs of all time, along with ""I Saw Her Standing There"". This is what I consider true Rock ""N"" Roll, which started to die soon after. Well it did. And no......Led Zeppelin isn't rock'n roll, Chuck Barry, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee Lewis...etc..etc, they are why thay tagged it ""Rock ""N"" Roll, it's all about the style and era, this album is the best of the early Beatles playing that style in what was really the end of that era.</span>,<span>This is the worst beatles album but that doesnt make it bad at all. The Beatles actually made this album in one day which is kinda sad if you think about it and at the time george martin believed they couldnt write a number one song and with this album there is no reason to suggest there would be some decent tracks like ""i saw her standing there"" ""twist and shout"" ""theres a place"" and georges scratchy yet pleasing version of ""chains"" but ""love me do"" is just embarrasing. all in all making three and a half stars is basically what it should be rated.</span>,<span>This is album is a great british invasion album. All their old love me or dont love or you dont love me kind of stuff. This is the album that made the band that changed music. MAJORLY. Even to this date listening to it brings back the school girl in me wanting to rush over to them and holding them. OK. Well. There are some not as strong tracks but still the album is great.<br><br>Best Track: Please Please Me<br>Worst Track: A Taste Of Honey <br><br>Track Ratings (out of 10):<br><br>1. I Saw Her Standing There /10<br>2. Misery /7<br>3. Anna (Go To Him) /8<br>4. Chains /6<br>5. Boys /6<br>6. Ask Me Why /8<br>7. Please Please Me /10<br>8. Love Me Do /10<br>9. P.S.

"<span>I think if I were to make a list of the 25 all time great rock &amp; roll songs ""I Saw Her Standing There"" &amp; ""Twist And Shout"" would be on that list. I like the whole production of this album and the fact that it was done within 24 hours, it's raw &amp; innocent, and basicly a live album of a band playing in a studio.</span>,<span>I don't find this album that particularly special or enjoyable to listen to.  However, it's passable.  ""Twist and Shout"" is a rocking little number.  ""Love me do"" is ok as is ""please please me"", ""I saw her standing there"" and ""Do you want to know a secret"".  The rest are nothing to write home about.</span>,<span>Well this is the first album from the Beatles. Nothing phenomenol , but it is a good buy. A great opening song with ""I saw her standing there."" This debut shows the many skills and talents the Beatles used to their advantage, which would become better known in the years to come. A wide variety of songs are included on this album, from slow songs like ""P.S I love you""  and ""Anna"" to classic hi-tempo songs like ""Twist and Shout"" plus the ever popular ""Love me Do."" A great start to the greatest band in the history of the world.</span>,<span>If this first Beatles album had contained all the songs Lennon/McCartney wrote for others instead of the 8 covers it would have been a total milestone. But at the beginning.....in this case Septmeber 1962.....there was little evidence of what was about to happen.Even ""Love me do"" based on Buddy Holly,was not to George Martin's initial liking when he suggested a song by a Tin Pan Alley writer which was no more than a piece of High School Pop and only because of the Beatles deliberately screwing it up made ""Love me do"" possible.<br>Quite an amazing premonition of their own abilities as its unlikely ""How do you do it?"" would have done anything and it paved the way for Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers,who were more attuned to pop music anyway<br>However its B side ""P S I LOve You"" showed that even at this stage the seeds were already sown.<br>""Please please me"" was a song which if slowed down could pass as a Roy Orbison one and both these singles were added to the first album with their respective B sides.<br>As for the covers,many can be seen as unsuitable nowadays,when a group of black girl session singers made the definitive ""Chains"" and this is because Goffin/King still held the reins.<br>More imagination was shown for ""A Taste Of Honey"",its only other vocal by a black singer called Lenny Welch,who at least sounded white.<br>The Arthur Alexander song was better by him as it contained a string section and again had a white sound to it as well as the fact that the artiste seemd intent on covering white material himself on his own album (which was no bad thing more blacks should have embraced High School Pop or country music) but as a song it was not good enough for the Beatles,who may have done better doing ""A shot of rhythm'n'blues"",the artistes previous record and a song covered at the same time by Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates<br>Only ""Twist &amp; Shout"" was improved on as the Isley Brothers version was ratty and thin sounding and the previous Top Notes original,made by Phil Spector,is one of the worst records he or anybody ever made on account of it being unfinished.When the Isley Brothers made it it was for no other reason than to update the idea of their own rubbishy ""Shout"" of the late 50s after being handed the song by the writers who hated the Top Notes version .<br>When you compared these inferior things to the stuff the 4 Most or Billy J Kramer were handed in the same year it was as if the Beatles had ended up with the short end of the stick. They could have made a great version of ""Hello little girl"" or ""Love Of The Loved"" but their versions existed only on demos and would be issued many years after they'd left the building. <br>Still the poor choice of covers continued. The 3 Perkins songs were understandable but George Harrison should have done ""Honey Don't"" as Ringo sounded as if he was reading a menu.<br>However the Beatles version of ""Twist &amp; Shout"" can be seen as definitive,and the Isleys rode on the back of it for their Ist U K chart entry,while the group Decca had preferred to them...Brian Poole &amp; the Tremeloes...desperate for a hit single,decided to copy their idea and took advantage of the fact that the Beatles version was only on E P and cost twice as much.It was not very good and was swamped with echo.It was already showing how unimaginative most artistes were and even the Kinks had done ""Long Tall Sally"" for their first single the year after<br>However not even the Beatles were able to make any more than what was a capable version but it suffered from the fact that Lennon never managed the scream all in one go,no doubt due to the fact he was hoarse at the time after an album was cut in a day and this was the last song.<br>Personally I think the Beatles would have been better going for some of the American songs of the day rather than the inferior ones of the 50s. They could have beaten the Trashmen for instance if they'd done ""Papa Oom Mow Mow"",which will always be a great piece of music<br>They could also have done a great ""Louie Louie"" and beaten the Kinks to it.<br>However whereas the Beatles hardly touched on High School Pop (a half hearted attempt on ""This boy"" which shouted out for strings) it was no more than a piece of fiction to suggest its chief exponents suffered because of them: Brian Hyland,Chris Montez,Tommy Roe and Paul Anka were to have their biggest successes in the late 60s,to say nothing of the new breed of girl High School Poppers like Leslie Gore and Diane Renay and Peggy March who continued the trend till it was revived in the next decade.Or the British version by Hermans Hermits.<br>However the main thing is until this album no group had ever come up with so much original material for a debut album so it was a landmark entry for that reason.<br>In todays climate the most unfortunate thing about the inferior covers is it detracts from the Beatles real purpose,that of creators of great songs and not Paul Mccartney impersonating Little Richard<br>It means that this is not the album to play to anyone you are trying to convince of their greatness</span>,<span>If you wanna crap on about how it was their first album and because of that it was a vital part of music history, being the debut of the biggest band around and starting the ""British Invasion"" then go ahead, feel free. The truth is it's pretty lame. I mean, it has a few okay old rockers but mostly it's schmaltzy. I don't consider it vital to the collection of the few younger fans of my generation who weren't around when The Beatles were big. Chances are they'll only screw their noses up at it. The only really good things are the title track ""Please Please Me"" and a couple of covers~which it has too many of anyway.</span>,<span>I Saw Her Standing There - one of their best early rockers, with an undeniably powerful bridge (""well, my heart went boom). 5.0<br>Misery - a bit cloying, a throwaway but kinda charming. 3.5<br>Anna (Go To Him) - decent attempt at soul from John. 3.0<br>Chains - George is offkey and the playing uninspired 2.5<br>Boys - Ringo kicks ass on lead vocals here! a highlight. 4.0<br>Ask Me Why - fairly intricate for the early days. 4.0<br>Please Please Me - incredibly inventive single. 5.0<br>Love Me Do - hardly inventive yet somehow inviting in its lowkey way. 3.5<br>P.S. I Love You - sure, it's cheesy but is expertly crafted. 4.5<br>Baby, It's You - great Bacharach cover with excellent Lennon vox. 4.5<br>Do You Wanna Know a Secret? - no, not if George is in this poor of voice. 2<br>A Taste of Honey - much ""schweeter"" than the previous track. 4.5<br>There's a Place - the Beatles' ""In My Room""? 4.0<br>Twist &amp; Shout - not a favorite but it's clearly a great showstopper. 4.0</span>,<span>The debut release from the Fab Four. In retrospect it sounds a little immature but there are a few signs of things to come. ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Love Me Do"" and ""Please Please Me"" are great pop songs and herald the beginning of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting partnership but the album's highlight ""Twist and Shout"" is actually a cover version.</span>,<span>Many people consider this album to be somewhat light weight and point out that there are too many covers. In retrospect that may be true. But one must understand that George Martin took a huge chance in signing a group that had been turned down by just about every other recording company in Britain. Their fans in Liverpool and Hamburg knew better but the suits in the industry were concerned with the bottom line. ""Love Me Do"" was a modest success as their first single. In an effort to help the single along, Brian Epstein order 50,000 singles for his own record stores. With the release of the single ""Please, Please Me"", George Martin knew he had a success on his hands. The best way to capitalize on that was to put an album out very quickly. Strike while the iron is hot. There was no better way to prove that he had made a wise decision in signing them. The album was recorded in one day and it is doubtful that the Beatles themselves were given a whole lot of say as to what songs would be included on the final release. I compare this album to the fall of the Bastille during the French revolution. The music industry would never be the same again. It gave birth the British Invasion and regardless of how its content is viewed today no one can deny that it was a historical landmark in the industry. It pretty much was the end of the Tommy Roes, Brian Hylands and Frankie Avalons of the world.</span>"
