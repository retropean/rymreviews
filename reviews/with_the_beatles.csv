"<span itemprop=""description""><a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVBkaC6eZUE"" target=""_blank""> It Wont Be Long</a><br><br>Taking a Class on the Beatles, woot<br><br>Any way a synopsis, It wont Be long this one is drum heavy. Im not sure who exactly sings it but it is more of a rocker. This is at the point in time where the boys were starting to really take off in the UK. Most of these songs would be spread out on the Beatles first American LP. It Wont be long is John Lennon singing. It has rich harmonies and is somewhere between ballad and rocker. It also has doo wop tendencies and that girl group sound I oh so love on the early albums. This album is said to have it's roots in Skiffle, folk rock, girl group pop, and 50's rock n roll. All My Loving a huge hit in the US and probally in the UK too. I think this one was sung by McCartney, it has a cool rock n roll send up in the guitar solo from the one and only George Harrison. Ringo is banging the drums like they owe him at this point and they are clearly starting to find there niche. This is when they were getting really big and they were doing live shows still. Dont Bother me is Harrison but it sounds very much like a McCartney track, this one is straight ahead and is about trying to get a girl back. The lyrics or symplistic. I love the background instruments on this one. I wonder if they were done by George Martin, the handclap thing and a country esque melody to it courtesy of Harrisons great prowless on the guitar.<br><br>Little Child, a rocker by Lennon this one really actually takes the roots of McCartney more however as the harmonca is a nice trick, as is the ode to Little Richard, and Jerry Lee Lewis. This was a fun little track. Till there was you sounds like something that Astraud Gilberto and her husband were doing in Brazil near this time. It has a samba/Brazilian sound to it, and McCartney has a nice vocal on it, he soothes and seranades like the spanish guitar touch. This is an obvious filler track but a good filler track. Mr. Postman is a cover of a song by the Marvelettes the all girl black group from the Motown sound. The song is very much in that vein and is very competent surprisingly considering how remarkable the original version is, Lennon sings like his life was dependent on a good performance and this makes you see what was happening in full circle, that these lads were taking sounds and adding to them. Roll Over Beethoven what is cool here is that Harrison does such a great job with the guitar you'd think that Chuck Berry him self did it. The vocals by Harrison or very different however and it is a weak point on the whole album, though I would not necessasarily list it as a bad track. <br>Hold Me Tight has a rocking 50's New Orleans R&amp;B/Rock N Roll sound, but you have vocals out of Brill Building style with Mccartney doing his usual swooning and trying to draw the girls in. The drums and guitars stick out as do the back ground vocals. I also like the verses. That beat is hypnotic though. You Really Got a Hold On me this is an old Smokey track but I think that the Beatles do great justice with the song, I still like Smokey's version more but this was not all that bad. Lennon has a strong vocal again, the drums by Ringo or spot on, and George Martin plays the piano nicely as well. I wanna be your man has my man Ringo Starr singing lead vocals this time, it is zany and you can see well why Ringo is known as the least favorite Beatle though he was always my second fave behind John. The song is stupid, pointless and not at all bad. Music goes every where it sounds like they are at jamming at a zoo and it is catchy too. Devil in your heart this one sounds somewhere between an Elvis movie and an Everly Brothers ballad, both from around the period 1960. This song too is very catchy and has the Beatle rich harmonies and hall mark sound that made them so popular with all the girls in '64, Harrison sings lead on this one but sounds like Lennon. Everything about this one is pretty awesome. Structured perfectly as well. Not a Second Time sounds like something that Carole King would write, the vocal cry a yi yi sound is something that I'd think Ennicio Morricone would do on one of his elaborate soundtracks. Again on this remaster the drumming sounds absolutely stunning and sharp. Harrison was one of the great guitarist, Ringo one of the best drummers, Paul was great with those beautiful ballads and Lennon was king supreme with his made for the charts rock n roll voice. Money was another cover  it is pretty good, I think I like it as much as the Barrett Strong original on motown but I loved other covers the most, and I did not really like the original. The strong point here is definantly Lennon, background vocals are surprisingly mediocre. Shonen Knight version rules for sure<br><br>The Beatles would keep getting better with time but this was however the time when they were best with the singles.

I want to be your man</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><strong class=""rymfmt"">Things I learned:</strong><br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">1.</strong> Their weakest studio album, assuming nobody's counting <em class=""rymfmt"">Yellow Submarine</em> as a Beatles studio album. <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles for Sale</em> often gets talked-about as their 'exhausted', 'worn-out' LP, but <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> deserves that legacy at least as much as the later album does. This one's got just as high a covers-originals ratio as <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, but where some of the covers on the debut were pretty close to definitive, the ones here - excepting ""Money"" - only add light spicing (so to speak). The originals are the real draw, and even those can be kinda patchy - for whatever reason(s). On top of which, side two is easily the dullest side of music on a Beatles LP. (Which isn't to say that the side's especially dull - it's just dull by Beatles standards, in that there isn't a single truly great song to be found.)<br><br>BUT...it's still quite good. Since it's the fuckin' Beatles. Any questions?<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">2.</strong> Okay, questions. First of all, I dunno how John was able to make those rhythm guitar triplets in ""All My Loving"" sound so great, but...man. They're so simple, but they're so untapped in this tone - and to a melody this memorable - that it almost feels like they're not even being played in real time. Paul's tune ain't hurtin', of course - this is one of his most unimpeachable melodies. Go ahead, try - attack the melody of ""All My Loving"" with everything you've got. WAIT! Okay, I've got my popcorn. <em class=""rymfmt"">Now</em> attack the melody of ""All My Loving"" with everything you've got.<br><br>Listen, also, to the way Ringo changes the beat in the choruses, from more of a flail to a sudden bang-out of insistent quarter notes - a simple change that makes those choruses hit harder, 'cause there's just a <em class=""rymfmt"">little</em> more space for the tune to worm its way into your system. And the song's ending is just terrific, coming to an abrupt final chord right when Paul's voice is starting to get even <em class=""rymfmt"">more</em> elated. Combined with that progressing vocal energy, that last chord feels like the guy put down the guitar a second later and said, 'All right, that's enough of that - time to give her all my loving.' Don't you love it when singers sing like they actually care about what they're singing? Yeah, me too.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">3.</strong> I dig the idea of using the harmonica in ""Little Child"", ditto the way the guys trade off their 'oh yeah's at the end. And I <em class=""rymfmt"">really</em> like the brief parts where John sings 'I'm so sad and looonely' - catchy. But for the most part, that song's pretty damn trite.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">4.</strong> ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", being released within a few weeks of the Rolling Stones's version, is an interesting scenario: the Stones wanna make it a very raw <em class=""rymfmt"">rock</em> song, and they half pull it off...whereas these dudes just wanna make their song a catchy ditty with a loud edge, and <em class=""rymfmt"">fully</em> pull it off. Take your pick. Me, I prefer the Stones's version, partly thanks to Charlie and partly 'cause I find Ringo's vocal disappointingly tame here. (Disappointing also because his vocal on the last album, ""Boys"", was so damn fun.)<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">5.</strong> ""All I've Gotta Do"" is a good solitude song, the loneliest on the album. I dig the way it sounds as though John's singing it from his bed - his 'yeah's are endearingly offhand, and the anxious 'You just gotta call on me!'s sound...well, <em class=""rymfmt"">earned.</em> Oh, and the simple *tss* of hi-hat is a clever treat: you might not even notice it until Ringo hits it just once as the transition out of the chorus. Mightily impressive how just one tap of a hi-hat can make for a fantastic transition...provided that you execute it perfectly. Just a reminder to y'all: Ringo was a great drummer. No, not 'underrated' or 'given too much flak' - <strong class=""rymfmt"">RINGO WAS A GREAT DRUMMER.</strong><br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">6.</strong> The melody in George's ""Don't Bother Me"" doesn't reach as far as it could've, and it's not quite a <em class=""rymfmt"">great</em> song. But it's the <em class=""rymfmt"">tone</em> that compels you; interesting how his singing already has a bit of the chromatic, Eastern-tinged qualities that would become so impressionable on him within a couple of quick years. Subliminally haunting.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">7.</strong> I might be forgetting some of the early B-sides - and I'm not counting the <em class=""rymfmt"">Anthology</em> stuff that never got official release during the band's heyday - but the version of ""Hold Me Tight"" on <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> would probably get my vote for the single worst Beatles song. Off-key much? And Jesus, that 'It feels so right' part sounds incredibly awkward. Strained. Strained like trying to fit a baseball through a drinking straw.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">8.</strong> Ah, the aforementioned covers. The one exception to my rant about the inferiority of the covers - as I mentioned earlier - is the closer, ""Money"", which is the equal of Barrett Strong's version thanks to another terrific screamer of a John vocal. John's already getting pretty nifty with his own voice's feedback: where on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>'s ""Twist and Shout"" he simply yelled the melody as loud as he could (albeit terrifically), here he waits 'til the song's last minute to go a little crazier. He even foreshadows that craziness in the way he sings the word 'I' in 'What it don't get, I can't use' in the verse before the solo. It sounds awesome.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">9.</strong> ""Please Mister Postman"", on the other hand, doesn't come <em class=""rymfmt"">close</em> to the more deservedly popular Marvelettes version. The way the guys sing the actual title seems like they're all stuck in one compressed pitch (which sorta ruins the best part) and the harmonies sound surprisingly callow. On the plus side, the way John's voice tangles with the others in the song's back half is quite effective. But it's kind of a disappointment how they actually play <em class=""rymfmt"">down</em> the sexual, adulterous undertones of the original. Or maybe they didn't notice them. Or maybe I'm the only one who thinks there are any sexual, adulterous undertones in ""Please Mister Postman"". I smell an essay topic!<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">10.</strong> The hand-claps in ""Roll Over Beethoven"" don't quite justify the cover, even if the guitar chords sound very <em class=""rymfmt"">on.</em> The 'oooo's sound kinda forced, too. It's always nice to be reminded of how great a lyricist Berry was, of course ('She wiggles like a glow worm/Dance like a spinning top' - magnifique), but I'll take ""Rock and Roll Music"", from <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles for Sale</em>, when I want a stronger Berry cover.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">11.</strong> I've heard some people hate on ""Till There Was You"", but I kinda dig it. You can hear why the melody-minded Paul connected with this song, with that wonderful leap on 'heard them ringing...' being very typically McCartney-ish. I'd hazard a two-pronged guess as to why this song might sound annoyingly simpering to some listeners: (a) it's a Broadway show tune (from <em class=""rymfmt"">The Music Man</em>; <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCbd6pxmVHY"" target=""_blank"">Peggy Lee's version</a> is probably the definitive), and (b) Paul's 'strictly gentle' way of <em class=""rymfmt"">singing</em> it - as often happened with him - can't help but espouse the lyrics, which are pretty...well, my computer's thesaurus gave me the word 'cupcake' as a synonym for 'wimpy', so...pretty cupcake. ('Sweet fragrant meadows of dawn' is laying it on a bit thick, no? Not all of those Broadway lyricists were Cole Porter, lest we forget.)<br><br>But on the plus side, George's acoustic underplaying is really good, and I love the way Paul sings 'There were birds in the sky/But I never saw them winging' and delivers the word 'saw' like 'soar.' That can't've just been an accident.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">12.</strong> Damn, ""It Won't Be Long"" is so <em class=""rymfmt"">fun!</em> That song is <em class=""rymfmt"">alive!</em> Listen to that harmonizing! Those 'yeah's! George's fills! <em class=""rymfmt"">Ringo's</em> fills! The bass, man - that fucking bass! Okay, this is the extent of my critical faculties on ""It Won't Be Long"". Onward....<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">13.</strong> The harmonies in ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"" are alarmingly basic, but John's got enough vocal charisma to carry it through. I have nothing more to say about ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"", and just wasted seven seconds of your life.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">14.</strong> Ohmygoditslikearollingstoneahshititsjustdevilinherheart.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">15.</strong> The melody of ""Not a Second Time"" is just okay, but the addition of the piano was a stroke of genius. Particularly in the middle: it's gloomier than you'd expect with what comes around it, which lends the song an exciting contrast of moods. Perhaps Paul picked up on that awesome piano for ""Every Little Thing""?<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">16.</strong> Admission: I've never liked that cover. It's a good photo, but it's also distractingly somber. Oh well, at least it led to the Residents parody. I have nothing more of interest to say about <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>.<br><br>A–.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I've got to admit that I just have problems listening to early Beatles material, and although I'm young and I've not heard all their albums, I'm certain I'll never really love one that predates <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em>.  There's a few reasons for that - the cognitive dissonance I get from hearing those voices that I love on other songs on songs that sounds like a completely different band, the impression they give of being forced to looked at popular music's baby photos by an over-eager aunt, the simple fact that they're really dated - but the end result is that, as much as I like The Beatles, I listen to their early years and barely recognise it as the work of the same people.<br><br>Praise is due for <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em>, then, because this is as close as I feel like I'll ever come to really connecting with a pre-drugs Beatles album.  The number of covers plays a part in that - I'm not too hot on ""Till There Was You"" or ""Devil in Her Heart"", but ""Please Mister Postman"", ""Money"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", and ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"" are great songs.  More important, though, is that they'd learned how to inject some style into their performances.  It feels a little like this is the moment the straightjacket comes off, for Harrison especially; it's as if the success they'd already had gave them the confidence to branch out a little.  ""All I've Got to Do"" is probably the best indicator of that, a song with a sly, offbeat riff and a slippery melody that's a leap forward in sophistication from anything on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> - they'd also started to embrace darkness a little, though not to anything like the extent they would later.<br><br>Yet, in contrast with that, <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> feels like the moment when The Beatles understood most clearly that they were a rock'n'roll band.  It's a real crowd pleaser, and consciously so, which means that it's focused and lean.  To say that they 'found their voice' here would be bollocks, because they had a number of different voices that they kept finding and losing right through their careers, but if you're speaking strictly about a young Beatles, this is the best expression of what they were about.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The finest of the Beatles' 8-originals-6-covers trio of LPs by a wide margin, and I'd dare say that their overall career would've been better served had this been their debut (with ""I Saw Her Standing There"" replacing ""Hold Me Tight"").  You've got the conspicuous introduction of George as a songwriting force to be reckoned with, a non-single nearly as popular as those that were, several underrated gems and the fiercest, angriest, awesomest cover song of their career.  Track by track:<br><br>""It Won't Be Long"" - One of the many areas the Beatles consistently excelled at was their choice of opening cuts.  “It Won’t Be Long” begins with John declaiming the title a cappella, and never lets up after that breathless moment.  The “yeah”s here not only links the song to “She Loves You”, but echoes the call-and-response of gospel, then being secularized by Ray Charles.  Unusual harmony vocals on the ""since you left me"" refrain (I can never quite make out what they're singing), Paul’s octave-leaping “Yeah!” on the final chorus, and John’s bursting-with-excitement delivery of “You’re coming home” make for yet another track any other group, then or now, would’ve released as a single.  <br><br>""All I've Got To Do"" - While “It Won’t Be Long” starts things off with a frantically enthusiastic bang, John follows it up by proving to be equally adept at balladry.  The stop-start melody allows Ringo one of his finest performances here, and I love the block harmonies on the middle eighth.  As usual on their early tracks, it’s the improvisations that puts them ahead of the competition - in this case, John stretches out the “I’ll” in “I’ll be here, yes I will, whenever you call” so much that he has to hurry the rest to keep up with the band.  A masterpiece of quiet assurance, from the opening chord to the humming fadeout.<br><br>""All My Loving"" - After John's potent one-two punch, it's up to Paul to come up with something just as memorable.  “All My Loving” certainly does the trick, becoming one of the Beatles’ most-loved non-singles (it actually charted in the States as a Canadian import).  This rollicking tune combined its author’s way of making greeting-card lyrics sound much less clichéd than they actually are with his love of rock, aided immeasurably by John’s speedy guitar fills, one of George’s finest early solos and a strong bass line. While John is definitely the dominant creative force of the pre-""Help!"" material, his partner can be counted on for a crowd-pleaser or two of his own.<br><br>""Don't Bother Me"" - Competing in the songwriting arena with John and Paul is a no-win situation for anyone, so credit must be given to George for holding his own throughout their career together.  His very first recorded composition, “Don’t Bother Me”, is quite a contrast to the exuberance of the Lennon-McCartney originals found elsewhere on this LP.  Rather than seek solace in the arms of a new love, George just wants to be left alone in his misery, a bit of post-adolescent self-torture than we can all remember, even if we don’t want to.  The downbeat melody, Ringo’s subdued work, and that vocal stretch to deliver “I know she’ll always be” add to the mood of angry petulance.  John would become known for exploring this angsty territory, but the Quiet Beatle got there first. <br><br>""Little Child"" - The boys sound like they’re having a blast, and John’s sarcastic “I’m so sad and lone-ly” is hilarious.  But this is still a filler track, right down to the “come on”’s, which bring to mind “Please Please Me”.  It’s better heard in the context of the LP than on its own.<br><br>""Till There Was You"" - A definite improvement over ""A Taste Of Honey"".  Despite Paul's pronunciation of ""saw"" as ""sore"", he manages to sound as sweetly romantic as he thinks himself to be, and George's delicate guitar work is a reminder that he's more than just a rocker.  <br><br>""Please Mister Postman"" - The band offers a near-carbon copy of the Marvelettes' chart-topper, with John wisely chosen as lead vocalist – can you imagine any of the others singing it?  As a result, it’s a near-equal to the original, though I suppose it could be argued that a girl would be more likely to be sitting around waiting for a letter than a guy would.  I've often wondered if it was recorded in acknowlegment of the love letters John wrote Cynthia while he was away on tour, though that seems a little too sentimental given his personality.<br><br>""Roll Over Beethoven"" - Despite George’s love for Carl Perkins, his most passionate and convincing vocal performance of someone else’s song is found right here.  Admittedly, it’s hard to go wrong with Chuck Berry’s standard, but George handles the solos with ease, and Ringo creates a joyful, cymbal-happy noise behind him.  Fans of the original are advised to check out the live version, which featurs a harmony vocal from Paul on the final chorus that I wish they’d done here as well.  <br><br>""Hold Me Tight"" - An out-of-tune throwaway (rejected for the ""Please Please Me"" LP, which should tell you something) that should never have seen official release, at least not until the “Anthology” series.  Even geniuses have their off days in the studio. I was shocked to hear this as one of the songs chosen for inclusion in ""Across The Universe"" - it sounds better there, maybe because it's sung in tune.<br><br>""You Really Got A Hold On Me"" - It would take a few years for John to approach Smokey Robinson's genius with a lyric, but his love for the Motown star's skill is evident on the Beatles' only cover of a Miracles tune.  Aided by one of George's best-ever harmony vocals, John's voice manages the nearly impossible feat of equalling Smokey's: he knows he's trapped by his emotions, but is helpless in the face of love.  In some ways, John's performances on the early tunes are his purest and most emotionally revealing - listen to his delivery of ""please"" and ""squeeze"" and I think you'll agree that the simplest of lyrics can speak volumes.<br><br>""I Wanna Be Your Man"" - Despite Paul’s shrieks, this is energetic fluff, notable mostly for some nice organ work from that other George and Ringo’s deadpan vocals.  It's also perhaps their only tune improved in the hands of another: the Stones slow this down and make the prospect of the title phrase horrifying, rather than lighthearted.<br><br>""Devil In Her Heart"" - I like Ringo’s maracas, and Paul’s bassline shows the rudiments of the dexterity to come.  But overall, this is a lukewarm performance of a tune that’s not that great to begin with.  Definitely the weakest of George's 3 vocal contributions here.<br><br>""Not A Second Time"" - This song is worth having on the basis of the ahead-of-their time harmonies at the end – only the Wilson brothers were doing this kind of thing in a rock context.  Fortunately, the rest of the tune is solid as well, with John’s paranoia front-and-center and Ringo’s drum figure between verses making up for the dorky piano solo.  It’s amazing how quickly their songwriting developed: even greater things were just an album away…  <br><br>""Money"" - John’s high point as an interpreter comes early in his career, covering Motown’s first-ever pop hit, which was given a fairly lighthearted delivery by Barrett Strong.  There's nothing flippant about the Beatles’ version – even the opening piano figure is pure menace, and once John spits out “The best things in life are free/but you can keep ‘em for the birds and bees”, any irony or good humor in the lyrics disappears without a trace.  Seattle bands aside, many musicians get into rock at least partly with the thought of becoming rich and famous, and nowhere is that fact spelled out more blatantly, or viciously, than it is here.  The final verse, with John screaming out his need for recognition while the harmonies offer ironic precision, is one of the most intense moments in rock music.<br><br>Even the casual fan should get their hands on most of the material here: it sounds remarkably fresh for music that's nearly half-a-century old.  My focus on the vocal performances might clue you in that the band's musical skills were rudimentary, but no more so than many of the acts working in the rock genre these days.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">So me and the Beatles, man, we go way back. I've been a fan of these guys as far back as I can remember, you know? But at the same point - and here I will commit sacrilege - I do prefer other bands. And whenever people ask me why, I say ""early Beatles,"" and that's usually all I've got to do. Which isn't a terribly eventful song, by the way. In fact, it's quite sappy, especially when weighed against later kick-ass Beatles love songs like ""Here, There, and Everywhere"" and ""Something,"" both of which are motherfucking CASH MONEY. This? Eeeeeh, not so much. Sorry, but if you don't make a solid album until your fifth, you don't get to be the greatest band ever in my book. And With the Beatles is a big ol' mess.<br><br>Actually, ""sappy"" is an issue here, which is odd because this is supposed to be the ""dark one"" or some similar nonsense. Y'know, the ""elegant black and white portraits of the band reflect on a more somber mood."" Somber? Ha. The only moment of somber you get here is on ""Don't Bother Me,"" George's first n' worst. At least ""Blue Jay Way"" and ""Within You, Without You"" are different and therefore a little more interesting than they'd be otherwise. ""Don't Bother Me"" is just dumb, and despite what I said, I am a Harrison fan. But I was talkin' sappy here, wasn't I? Ah, yes. ""Devil in Her Heart,"" ""Hold Me Tight,"" ""Till There Was You,"" and ""Little Child,"" all on the same album? Argh. ""Devil's"" got those ridiculous harmonies and terribly shit lyrics (although I understand the latter wasn't their fault), ""Hold Me Tight"" has atrociously off-key vocals in the chorus that just sound horrid, ""Till There Was You"" is a fucking version of ""Till There Was You,"" and ""Little Child"" is WAAAAAAY too perky for me, and I'm a Belle &amp; Sebastian fan. I mean, if there was some sort of sick irony behind ""Little Child,"" I'd probably love it to death. But it's just... urgh. Merf. Blerk. <br><br>However, there is good stuff here! Once you over look those six and ""Not a Second Time,"" which is perhaps the most forgettable song the Beatles ever penned (apparently it uses an AEOLIAN CADENCE! Which is, um, great. I guess the Beatles invented Aeolian cadences now. Thanks, wikipedia!), you'll get good stuff! Not great stuff by any means, because we are talking early Beatles here, but you know? ""It Won't Be Long"" and ""All My Loving"" are fun songs! ""All My Loving"" is actually one of my favorite early Beatles songs, and ""It Won't Be Long"" kicks up some ""I Saw Her Standing There""-style early rock dust. Meanwhile, ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""Money"" are both kind of hilarious, just because that was 1963's equivalent of Morbid Angel. They're also both good covers - I wouldn't take either over the originals, unlike their awesome version of ""Twist and Shout"" that's one of like four good songs on <a title=""[Album17]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/please-please-me-64/"" class=""album"">Please Please Me</a>, but young Lennon really had a voice for that sort of thing, you know? Same goes for the versions of ""Please Mr. Postman"" and ""You Really Got a Hold on Me."" Competent covers, but they won't make you forget the originals. There might be another song on this album, too, but it's clearly not of interest as I didn't mention it. <br><br>And how about those two singles that were on the more famous <a title=""[Album17362]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/meet-the-beatles-23/"" class=""album"">Meet The Beatles!</a> (the only one of the bastardized Capitol albums that anyone cares about at all, and it's actually a lot better than either of the band's first two Parlaphone albums, if you'd believe that one)? Well, we all know ""I Want to Hold Your Hand,"" and while it's a solid example of what rock was like before Zappa got the mid '60s revolution rolling (you think I'm kidding? <a title=""[Album3651]"" href=""/release/album/the-mothers-of-invention/freak-out-1/"" class=""album"">Freak Out!</a> actually predates <a title=""[Album206]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/revolver-5/"" class=""album"">Revolver</a>, and in fact was a big inspiration on McCartney), I'm not too impressed with it. Good? Certainly. I'm just saying, there are fifty thousand better Kate Bush songs. Same with ""She Loves You,"" but I like that more than ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."" It's infectious, and also kind of hilarious, because apparently a lot of American religious folks tried to make the Beatles out as this cult that brainwashed people by singing ""YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!"" over and over again until the kids bought their records. I mean, it's dumb as a box of socks full of rocks, but it's fun. Can't say I'm too excited about either, though. Early Beatles, you know?

The cat continued...""Man, were these young fellows on a roll or what. This album was released a few short months after the debut, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please, Please Me</em>. At this time the Beatles were makin' young English girls wet their panties with an intensity not to be seen in the good 'ol USA until the following year. These guys are gonna be big.

I directed the rockin' housecat to cue-up the disc in CD changer and push play.<br><br>Soon John Lennon was belting out the vocals on the opening uptempo track ""It Won't Be Long"", to be followed by another Lennon track, ""All I've Got To Do"".

""I like the popular McCartney track, ""All My Loving"". Hellava song. Nice Harrison guitar, too. I make a mix tape of Beatles love songs for the Wife and they are all McCartney songs"". ""OK"", said the rockin' houscat. ""I still prefer the rockers on this album including ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and Lennon's cover of ""Money"" along with a passable ""Please Mister Postman"". However, no one will confuse Lennon with Motown. Speaking of covers, the band does a credible version of Chuck Berry's rockin' classic ""Roll Over Beethoven"".

"<span itemprop=""description"">Of course I had the education that my dad flung on me of the importance in this record and how the day it was released in the US became a turning point in popular culture.<em> Meet The Beatles </em>may not be the Beatles most solid work or their most creative, but it was my introduction into this fine group and for that reason it holds its on little piece of history within my life (even if I was born 17 years after the release).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Just like “Please Please Me” you will know and love each of these songs.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A lot happened between the release of the bubblegum pop nightmare of<em> Please Please Me </em>and its follow up,<em> With the Beatles.</em>  The band scored their first number one hit with “From Me to You”, and then a second with “She Loves You”.  The latter also gave them their first American number one and Beatlemania was set in motion.  The band’s songwriting ability was obviously growing and George Martin’s confidence in their ability grew with it.  Although<em> With the Beatles </em>still contains six cover versions (less than was usual in those days), the artists being covered were better chosen and seemed to be picked to fit in with the Beatles changing sound.  With<em> Please Please Me </em>it was the reverse, with the band obviously attempting to emulate the slow paced crooners who made up a percentage of their repertoire.  Those days were long gone, though.  No-one was trying to mould the Beatles into nice boys you could take home to meet your mother anymore.  This is evident from the cover art.  Gone are the cheeky, smiling faces of the well-dressed young men looking down from the balcony.  Four stern looking guys in black clothing, their faces partially obscured by darkness, had replaced them.  This iconic image suggest something harder edged than the syrup of<em> Please Please Me,</em> and<em> With the Beatles </em>went someway to delivering on this promise.<br><br>Just as<em> Please Please Me </em>opened with the dancefloor friendly “I Saw Her Standing There”, so<em> With the Beatles </em>kicks off with Lennon’s “It Won’t Be Long”.  Partially aping the hugely popular “She Loves You” with its “yeah yeah yeah” based chorus, “It Won’t Be Long” is a strong opener.  There were no singles released from<em> With the Beatles </em>but had there been, this would undoubtedly have been front of the queue.  Its call and response chorus pouts shamelessly and could have made it a hit.  In contrast, the album flows on to another Lennon number, “All I’ve Got to Do”, a slower, darker sounding song.  It explores the same themes as the clichéd love songs of<em> Please Please Me </em>but is full of the sincerity that was missing from those teeth-rotting ditties.  Besides that, “All I’ve Got to Do” allies its lyrics to an excellent, moody tune which breaks into a shining but subtle chorus.  This one-two punch of Lennon songs kicks off<em> With the Beatles </em>in cracking form and banishes fears of a repeat of the thickly layered schmaltz of<em> Please Please Me.</em>  <br><br>Not to be outdone, McCartney quickly contributes “All My Loving”, another run-of-the-mill love song lyrically but again the music is top-notch.  A tuneful, danceable piece of pop which keeps the momentum of the album going beautifully.  This tracks catchy appeal meant it became by far the most well known song from<em> With the Beatles.</em>  The band’s sound was beginning to take shape and they were falling into their rolls.  Lennon’s harder-edged tracks were perfectly complimented by McCartney’s perfect pop.  Step forward the always enigmatic Harrison, always my favourite Beatle.  The sinister rumble of “Don’t Bother Me” was Harrison’s first composition and is one of the most intriguing and unique works on the whole album.  Although it is virtually forgotten by most fans, “Don’t Bother Me” is the edgiest track on offer here.  Although it explores lost love, the lyric turns misanthropic rather than self-pitying and this dark, brooding anger is brilliantly mirrored in the stop-start musical accompaniment and Harrison’s confident delivery, a million miles from his nervous whimpering on the previous album.  Harrison was often, and often still is, under-appreciated but “Don’t Bother Me” is an album highlight.<br><br>Relief is at hand in the rock ‘n’ roll of “Little Child”, a collaboration between Lennon and McCartney, the result of which is a concise, rocking dancefloor filler with superbly cutting harmonica parts and a lyric aptly set on the dancefloor, Lennon begging the “Little Child” of the title to dance with him (I suspect the child in question is not actually that little!  Gary Glitter had no part in writing the song).  Unfortunately, this little party song is followed by _With the Beatles_’s first bum note, after which the album never quite regains its momentum which the first five excellent tracks set in motion.  The bum note in question is the McCartney sung cover of the show tune “Till There Was You”, a mawkish croon which brings back memories of _Please Please Me_’s range of turgid cover songs.  Similar in lyrical and musical aspects to the Carpenter’s “Close to You”, the song references singing birds, sweet fragrant meadows and wonderful roses in relation to the arrival of the love interest.  This soppy track doesn’t fit well amongst the surrounding materiel and is only present because, despite their self-penned number one hits the big boss men still weren’t confident enough that the band’s songwriting could carry a whole album.  Fools.<br><br>Still, while the cover versions may be a formality, they are certainly a huge leap on from those chosen for<em> Please Please Me.</em>  The Marvelettes “Please Mister Postman” is an uptempo track which utilises vocal harmonies to great effect and reinstates the energy that the album temporarily lost.  But it is the subsequent cover of Chuck Berry’s “Roll Over Beethoven” that really hits the mark.  You can’t really go wrong with Chuck Berry (unless you’re asking to use his ladies toilet) but the Beatles go one step further and top the original by harnessing the superb energy with which they had previously made “Twist and Shout” their own.  Wisely judging the song’s sardonic tone perfectly, the band passed vocal duties to the massively improved Harrison whose heavy Liverpudlian drawl serves the song better than a retread of Lennon’s visceral rock ‘n’ roll screech could have done.<br><br>Sadly, “Roll Over Beethoven” is so good it makes the already limp “Hold Me Tight” seem even worse.  Eventually panned by the band themselves, “Hold Me Tight” sounds as if it starts in the middle with the misplaced cry of “It feels so right” appearing at the beginning.  Too eager to please, the song goes on to grind its weak chorus down with repetition.  The cover of Smokey Robinson and the Miracles “You Really Got a Hold on Me” is a bit better but it feels laboured.  The band’s hearts don’t seem to be in it and it compares badly with the original.  Besides which the song, in common with “Till There Was You”, feels out of place, a soul ballad in amongst a primarily rock ‘n’ roll album.<br><br>Things pick up again with McCartney’s “I Wanna Be Your Man”, also recorded by the Rolling Stones.  A groovy, danceable blast of wild rock ‘n’ roll, this great song was given to Ringo to provide vocals.  This would seem like an unwise move but instead it proves inspired.  Ringo’s tendency to throw himself into vocal duties and just have a good time means that his upbeat attitude rubs off on the song.  Also, the low pitched vocals that the song requires are well suited to Ringo’s clod-hopping vocal style.  The result is a successful party anthem.<br><br>Sadly, the hit and miss nature of the album tips towards miss again and the Donays cover “Devil in her Heart” rears its ugly head.  Not out of place like the other two failed cover versions, this rock ‘n’ roll ballad still feels like fluff in comparison to the other tracks.  Sung by Harrison, the song flounders and drags, feeling longer than its 2:25 lifespan.  Lennon’s lyrically bitter but musically workmanlike “Not a Second Time” cannot pick up the pieces, although it passes pleasantly enough.  It lacks a satisfying hook and fades out before anything really seems to have happened.<br><br>Thankfully, the album is not allowed to tail off, repeating _Please Please Me_’s trick by closing with a ferocious rock ‘n’ roll cover.  A significant shake up of Barrett Strong’s “Money” finds Lennon reprising his primal roar, complete with screams leading into musical breaks.  The wild performance winks slyly at the listener, acknowledging the tongue in cheek nature of this capitalist anthem.  While “Twist and Shout” stood out as a great cover on a lousy album, “Money” feels wholly appropriate as a closer for this far more energetic album.<br><br>_With the Beatles_ moved the band on a giant leap from the dingy<em> Please Please Me.</em>  The original compositions shine out of the album rather than blending in with the cover versions, which this time round are chosen with much more care.  All in all,<em> With the Beatles </em>finds the band toying with edgier ideas, moving away from what the bosses were trying to mould them into.  Listening to<em> Please Please Me,</em> it is easy to imagine the Beatles having released “How Do You Do It” as their first single as George Martin intended.  Listening to<em> With the Beatles </em>makes this notion seem ridiculous.  Goodbye bubblegum, hello rock ‘n’ roll.  Although ultimately uneven as an album, _With the Beatles was an important step forward for the band.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">""The Beatles never wrote a bad album!""<br><br>""...

"<span itemprop=""description"">Released just 8 months (to the day) after <strong class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album17]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/please-please-me-64/"" class=""album"">Please Please Me</a></strong>, The Beatles' sophomore effort doesn't stray that far from the formula of its predecessor. However, the album proves to not significantly lesser in quality as the songwriting skills of Lennon-McCartney are just as strong and the covers are those of well-composed pop songs. The only truly notable aspects of <strong class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</strong> are the presence of the band's first sort-of ballad (""Till There Was You"") and the first Beatles song to be written by George Harrison (""Don't Bother Me"").<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">7.8/10</em></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like their debut, a collection of original compositions and covers. All My Loving is the stand out. <br>Lesser known highlights: Don't Bother Me (George Harrison), and You Really Got a Hold on Me (Smokey Robinson cover)</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles' second album is a pretty big leap for them, even if it's not particularly good. Their original material is more mature, but awkward at times. The subject matter is growing to more than just the kind of youthful and at times shallow love the previous album conveys, though they haven't fully gotten used to writing songs like that yet. The obvious highlight is All My Loving, a gorgeous love song showing the early Beatles at their emotional peak, and the only song I can wholeheartedly recommend from this album. Though most of the originals are worth a shot, none of them have the same passion the originals on Please Please Me did. Next up, the covers. Most of the covers are worse than on Please Please Me and have better and more famous originals. Listen to those instead, none of the ones here are really worth it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It Won't Be Long almost starts in mid-song.  All I've Got to Do has a nice skiffle (?) beat.  As usual Zephos is correct.  This is a bit more beefy and muscular than their debut. (nice choice of words big guy!)  It's just all sharp and crisp, like George's solo on his track Don't Bother Me.  The playing, the harmonies, the melodies, all of it!  Yes maybe they are using the covers as a chance to work on rhythm.  Til There Was You features Ringo on the bongos.  And a clear inspiration for Paul's classical melodies, like Michelle my belle.<br><br>Mr. Postman:  young John's howling, screaming, scratching pleading voice is just fantastic.  What else can I say?  Hold Me Tight is a strong original, again it's the rhythm section standing out here.  Been practicing eh Paul?  A pretty much impeccable Smokey cover.  I Wanna Be Your Man: for some reason the descending riff reminds me of the Flintstones or some Hanna Barbara tune.  I think Not a Second Time marks the first appearance of piano, and in the lower register at that.  Yep, definitely some experimentation on this record, even though I'm sure it was rushed out following the debut.  And I have to note that it was actually released on the day of JFK's assassination.<br><br>The debut had better originals and the best cover (Twist and Shout).  It's a slightly better record, though this one shows both development and absolute professionalism and taste.  So it's also an 8!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like a Please Please Me redux but inexplicably loads better, With The Beatles borrows near enough the same template but benefits from a bit more care and attention. Most of the recordings stand out as fairly solid except for the stultifying simplisiosity of I Wanna Be Your Man. While not raked with supreme highlights, WTB is blessed with consistency and still stands as a worthy Beatles long-player.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> is a slight step up from the debut, being that their songwriting improved over the months in between. Already, John Lennon and Paul McCartney had moved beyond tripe like ""Love Me Do"" and started writing more ""mature"" pop songs. ""All I've Got To Do"" and ""All My Loving"" are great; some of the greatest work that The Beatles recorded in their early years. George Harrison gives his first try at songwriting, and it's not half bad. ""Don't Bother Me"" is surprisingly developed for someone's first song. Not to say some of the songs aren't bad. ""Little Child"" is the worst song The Beatles ever wrote; annoying vocals, annoying harmonica, and poor lyrics. The covers are also better than the ones on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. Of course, this is nowhere near any of their later albums. In fact, if you told someone in 1963 that Beatles songs were to be studied as if they were works of art, they would have taken it as a joke. It's still a more cohesive album than whatever else pop groups were doing back then; singles were still the norm. There's no filler, but taken with the context of the Beatles later work, it's merely okay.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Barely a step up from <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me,</em> this one has a few remarkable tracks (It Won't Be Long, I Wanna Be Your Man, Roll Over Beethoven) but the second half is downright disastrous other than two tracks. You can even see the same bland ideas repeated throughout the album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I like this more than their debut. Its obviously still very much 60's pop rock before their psychedelic epiphany, but i found the overal track list much more enjoyable. There is still a bit too much love ballads in here, but there is a darker and grittier edge to the songs that i appreciate more. You actually hear more of the guitars in the songs, it sounds like it is rock first and pop second. ""dont bother me"", ""please mister posterman"" and ""you really got a hold on me"" are the best tunes in here, and basically trump anything of their debut.      <br><br>The issue with this album is that half of these tunes dont really register with me. They are not bad, and even a bit enjoyable while they are playing, but they are completly unmemorable after they are done. The covers are well done, so good job on that.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Just listening to Please Please Me and With the Beatles, the difference between the two albums is obvious. Whereas Please Please Me was the transition piece from late-50s, early-60s R&amp;B, and thus kept things exceedingly lightweight, With the Beatles is dark and heavy. Look no further than ""You Really Got a Hold on Me"" for a prime example. From the opening piano notes, the song has a weight to it even in the most pop-y of times.<br><br>The Beatles also show signs of developing songwriting skills. ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All I've Got to Do"", and ""All My Loving"" are pure mid-60s power pop, I think in large part to Ringo taking the time to develop unique drum lines for every song, rather than falling back on standard rhythms. <br><br>That's not to say they've completely shed the R&amp;B roots (the genre's roots, not necessarily the band's roots). Songs like ""Please Mister Postman"", ""Hold Me Tight"", and ""Roll Over Beethoven"" all maintain the . I've never been a huge fan of ""Hold Me Tight"", the chorus is somewhat flat and one-noted, and the verses sound like they're building to a better chorus that never arrives. The cover songs, however, are both solid and entertaining interpretations of the originals.<br><br>For some reason, I always go into ""Devil in Her Heart"" and ""Not a Second Time"" thinking I dislike the songs, but coming out surprised. ""Devil in Her Heart"" is genuinely fun, particularly the way McCartney's vocals spring out of the harmonies in the chorus. ""Not a Second Time"" isn't quite as good, and is actually fairly forgettable, but still decent while it's being listened to.<br><br>On the bad side, ""Money"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" are throw-away tracks, the latte being inferior to the Rolling Stones version, showing the song needs more darkness than The Beatles were capable of. ""Money"" just isn't very well composed, making it something of a mess from beginning to end. ""Little Child"" isn't bad, but it's totally useless on this album, coming from the surprisingly nice ""Don't Bother Me"" and the genuinely great (if overshadowed by ""And I Love Her"", the other Beatles slow song with spanish-tinged acoustic guitar and minimalistic drum parts sung by McCartney) ""Till There Was You.""<br><br>It's actually incredible how popular The Beatles were at this point in their careers. This is before the first film, before the sitars, before Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, before travelling to India, and before (most of) the drugs. Yet, here they are, their ability to write songs only developing and expanding as their careers continued on, arguably outpacing their popularity.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I'm always sad to say this, but in recent years I've grown a bit colder on the fab four than when I was a kid. Even these basic songs which were all I knew back then!<br>But I understand why... no, it's not that ALL of these songs are lovesongs (The Stones got away with this as well)... it's not even so much that these songs are sometimes painfully simple (because in general there's nothing wrong with simplicity)... it's mostly that there's a whiff of boybandery. Yes, it's a bit silly to blame The Beatles for the shit that <em class=""rymfmt"">followed</em>, but frankly, had The Beatles come up with this material today and not 50 years ago it wouldn't have been wide off the teen-pop mark - unless some other band took their place back then, but that's beside the point. the point being, most of these songs are much too sweet.<br>I'll always have great memories of The Beatles, mind you, but between them and The Stones, as with Oasis and Blur, I'm usually on the lads' side (not calling anyone girls, though).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is little more than a collection of limp, inoffensive pop tunes. Songs like “Please Mister Postman” are unlistenable for the trite melodies and brainless lyrics. Some of the material is fun (“It Won’t Be Long”), and the vocals are good, but by today’s standards this is bland, banal pablum.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not necessarily better than the debut but clearly more professional and more consistent. Even the covers are pretty damn good, easily some of the best covers The Beatles ever cut (goot thing too cause there's a lot of them). But as usual, the real meat is in the originals and we've got some good ones here that show John &amp; Paul's growth as composers and ol Georgie boy makes his songwriting debut with ""Don't Bother Me"" (which I've always thought was underrated). Main highlights: ""Not A Second Time"", ""It Won't Be Long"" and ""All My Loving"".</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">“Close your eyes and I’ll kiss you, tomorrow I’ll miss you…”</em><br><br>That’s more like it! This is ‘Please Please Me’, but every single thing is improved upon. The production is less old-fashioned, the compositions are even less old-fashioned, the songs are catchier, more memorable and performed beautifully. This is the first Beatles album that truly lets the listener hear the full extent of the talents that lay in the band, in a conventional way of course. ‘All My Love’ boasts quintessential vocal performances, both lead and harmony, ‘Please Mr. Postman’, ‘Roll Over Beethoven’ and ‘Money’ showcase their impressive ability to take existing songs and make them their own, and the same goes for ‘You Really Got a Hold On Me’, but I wanted to count it separately because it’s my favourite song on the album. The vocal harmonies in the song are so beautifully dissonant, so ahead of their time, so insane. ‘Hold Me Tight’ sounds like it’s supposed to be ‘Please Please Me’ part two, and I can dig that.<br><br>Production /<br>Composition +<br>Performance +<br>Listenability +<br>Flow/Consistency +<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Best songs – ‘All My Loving’ – ‘Please Mr. Postman’ – ‘Roll Over Beethoven’ – ‘Hold Me Tight’ – ‘You Really Got a Hold On Me’ – ‘Money (That’s What I Want)’.<br>Weakest songs – ‘Little Child’ – ‘Not a Second Time’.</em><br><br>Rating – A</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's the Beatles album where the covers are better than the original material. Mind, the covers are definitely among the best they did but still...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles second album, <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>, may be bolstered with superior production (even note the exquisite yet pretentious cover, famously photographed by Robert Freeman) over its predecessor, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, but it's not nearly as successful as an LP.  For starters, this is probably the one Beatles long-player that is not blessed with at least one amazing song.  Of their lesser albums, <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> has ""Twist and Shout""; <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles for Sale</em> has ""Eight Days a Week""; even my least favorite Beatles LP, <em class=""rymfmt"">Help!</em>, has a handful of classics in ""Help!"" ""Yesterday,"" and ""Ticket to Ride.""  The best tracks on <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> are the opener, ""It Won't Be Long,"" and the show they opened their widely-viewed debut on <em class=""rymfmt"">The Ed Sullivan Show</em> with, ""All My Loving,"" which features one of many great Paul McCartney basslines and fast, shuffling rhythm guitar work by John Lennon.  Rivaling these two cuts is Ringo Starr's take on ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" which Lennon and McCartney originally wrote for The Rolling Stones.  The Beatles' version is superior, as this is the cut that most resembles the exuberance of their debut.  That being said, there are only a few duds here, and they are covers.  The schmaltzy ""Till There Was You"" (from the musical <em class=""rymfmt"">The Music Man</em>) and ""Devil In Her Heart"" are some of the group's weakest output.  There a few other highlights: their three Motown covers (""Please Mister Postman,"" ""You Really Got a Hold on Me,"" and ""Money"") are fairly strong; also, ""Don't Bother Me"" is George Harrison's first stab at songwriting, and is easily the darkest number on this set.  Also, their overlooked rocker ""Hold Me Tight"" maybe the most fun track on the album, and their take on Chuck Berry's ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is refreshing.  The Beatles were already a big deal in England when <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> hit the shelves.  Beatlemania was only four months away in the States!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The interesting thing about the early Beatles' albums is that they were more vehicles for their non-single tracks than a chance to display them. I suppose that was norm of the time. Singles were the drivers of the market. The singles charts were way more important than the albums charts. Also, jukeboxes were often the only way that people could hear a song they liked without having to pay for the single.<br><br>This album is loaded with songs that didn't really dominate the charts. You could be a cynic and say this album was a way to make some smaller songs that didn't make their way into the charts. It's almost half covers. Only one song on here is something you would immediately identify as an iconic Beatles' song. In spite of that fact, the Beatles find a way to make the covers their own and the originals are very solid offerings. 'Roll Over Beethoven' often gets played alongside Chuck Berry's original. The same goes for 'Money'. Whether or not that is due to the fact that that is indeed because the Beatles are the ones playing remains to be seen.<br><br>You don't get much departure from the first album with this offering. It's more of the same. That makes sense. If the band can bang out quality recordings in less than a couple of weeks, why the fuck not? The quality of the songs is a slip dip from the previous record but not majorly. It's enjoyable.<br><br>Pros: 'Till There Was You', 'You Really Got A Hold On Me', 'Money', 'All My Loving'<br><br>Cons: 'Don't Bother Me', 'Devil In Her Heart', 'All I've Got To Do'</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Easily one of the worst Beatles albums, most of the songs here are very repetitive and have very few memorable moments throughout the record.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Certainly a smart and marketable move to make back then for a sophomore effort, <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> would remain the most danceable entry in their catalogue. By this time, the Beatles were already professionals in the studio as well, but their energy and raw desire to make the girls dance is still more than palpable. The record focuses on tight songs that twist and jive to precise rhythms, there’s still a fair share of covers really stressing their rhythm&amp;blues roots, but ditching the originals’ rawness – overall, this is the definition of light, danceable, giddy, hedonistic merseybeat.<br><br>„It Won’t Be Long“ is one of their catchiest songs (with the good idea of starting with the hook instead of building up to it). You can tell they were still trying to figure out how to work best as a band as George gets to take quite a lot of lead vocals (something Lennon/McCartney would put an end to as soon as they wrote all of the published material), and he does really well because of his softer tone. They repeat the trick of the debut by ending on a severely rocking note with the Motown classic „Money“, and expand their all-encompassing pop versatility with the pastoral pop cover of „Till There Was You“. While the originals (besides the mentioned opener) still aren’t better than their impeccably chosen and performed covers (some definite versions of the respective songs here I’d say), this record was made to show the world that the (back then seriously firm) borders between traditional songcraft, light pop and rock&amp;rolling rhythm&amp;blues were soon to be obsolete. <br><br>All of this, of course, results in a stone cold classic, just as every other proper Beatles album. It’s just that this one, to me, has aged the most. I put it on during parties, but rarely as a listening experience by itself. Gotta dig John’s beginning singer-songwriting melancholia on „Not a Second Time“ though, which could almost count as the albums great downer if it weren’t immediately washed away by the heavy piano thumps of „Money“.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Basically <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> except the covers are just a tad bit worse.<br><br>Favorite Songs:<br>""It Won't Be Long""<br>""Don't Bother Me""<br>""I Wanna Be Your Man""<br>""Money (That's What I Want)""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">There is a chronology to The Beatles discography, but it’s one that few people agree on and yet there is a canon. regardless <em class=""rymfmt"">of</em> that canon, I’ve always called this ‘the second Beatles album’. and isn’t it? <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> came a month after my mother’s birth and five whole months before my father’s, but once <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> was buggying around America, both parents were cribbed and pacifiered and on the track that would lead them on the 23-year journey to meeting. and, The Beatles took Earth by storm nearly as soon as this plan were set. The Beatles have this special association to me therefore, even with my mom rarely ever listening and my dad being more dadrock than your dad (so naturally, he doesn’t talk much about The Beatles. why do that when you can talk about the time you touched Jimmy Page’s hand at the bar you bounced?). the cover for this suffers from the facelessness I attribute to The Beatles, and the fact that their hair makes them near-indistinguishable from one another to me. there’s even a conspiracy theory in the 2010s that<a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://thebeatlesneverexisted.com/"" target=""_blank""> the Beatles never existed,</a>. I bet they had on this album or the one that followed to make that assessment.<br><br>this… actually has some of the killers. it has “It Won’t Be Long” and the image we all have of Evan Rachel Wood on her bed, kicking, her military man’s portrait clutched to a bosom; there’s “All My Loving” and the fact that you could drunkenly slur it at your girlfriend to make her think you’re being off-the-cuff romantic; “Hold Me Tight” is the king of the album to me, even in just making fun of the ‘dancing white people at a sockhop’ trope, it really feels like that was a time to be enjoyed rather than using dancing to forget the shittiness of the 1960s in kinetic reverie. I feel like there’s little in way of escape thru The Beatles here like they cultivated in their biggies. <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em> can, in my opinion, hold a candle to this in terms of how good it is though, and I’m tempted… so tempted… to just make this a 7/10 to that abbey’s six. or at least start thinking of it as such. even those who were put-off by the way the world now turned, the axis could be restored on the one-two of “Please Mr. Postman” / “Roll Over Beethoven” renditions, the heart of rock ‘n’ roll turning us all into perpetrators of a soul graffiti called The Beatles. I assume their earliest sounds brought zaniness because what I’m guessing at here, so I’ll leave it at that. possibly their best pre-<em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> record. possibly.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This album is all about ""All My Loving"" that song towers above everything else here by a mile. There are some other good songs (""Money"", for example), but nothing else shows the brilliant songwriting abilities this group had like that song. That said, most of these songs aren't bad, they're just not that great. Of course there are some duds like ""All I've Got to Do"", which sounds like an Everly Brothers rip off to me, and ""Devil in Her Heart"", which couldn't be more boring if it tried.<br><br>Favorite tracks: All My Loving, Don't Bother Me, Not a Second Time, Money</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">'With The Beatles' followed the pattern from their debut, with featuring partly covers and partly original songs. But to say, this album isn't a huge improvement over the debut is wrong.<br>First of all, Beatlemania was already a thing when this album was released and I am certain that you can hear a special new gained self-confidence on this album.<br>Secondly, the production is way better. Especially the drums sound great and Ringo finally gets the attention he deserves.<br>And thirdly, the songs are much better written and feature even better instrumentation.<br>After the schmalz Pop they delivered on 'Please Please Me' and the resulting success of it, The Beatles got -apparently- the allowance to be more confrontational with their music. They get enough creative freedom for their rebellious nature and so you can hear much more their Rock n' Roll influences, which suits me -and them- well.<br>The covers are this time not as strong as the covers from their debut, but still pretty great. The worst one must be 'Roll Over Beethoven', mostly because they just can not add that much to that song. My favorite must be 'Devil in Her Heart'.<br>But much better this time are the original songs.<br>Whether its the fast 'It Won't Be Long', which kicks off this album in a great fashion or the soothing 'You Really Got a Hold on Me', every original song by them on here is great.<br>But the defintive highlight of this album must be George Harrison's first self-written Beatles song 'Don't Bother Me'. Not just because it is his first song, but also because it is so damn cool and different. He already established with this song his underdog character within this band.<br>Overall this album is an amazing early Beatles album, maybe not as historically important as their debut album, but a big improvement over it.<br><br>4,5 stars</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">thrasher2809's Beatles Overanalysis #2<br><br>Right, now I know this one's better than the debut but nowhere near as good as A Hard Day's Night, but I'm a bit rusty on the album on the whole, particularly the covers. So I'll get some learning in too.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">It Won't Be Long</strong><br>IMO one of the most unsung early Beatles tracks, this one's killer. Along with She Loves You, this is another example of them using the chorus to start the song. I always thought the change from Emaj to Cmaj back to Emaj in the verse was a bit unusual, as is the extra measure in the verses that puts them into quasi 12/8 time. And that middle eight! Holy hell, where else would you hear that descending chromatic progression in 63 outside of soul or gospel? Not to mention the brilliant closing harmony melody, ending on another one of their major seventh tricks. This puppy goes a lot of different places in two minutes.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">All I've Got To Do</strong><br>Love the swagger. Also, the opening chord is an Eaug11. Which is fucking ridiculous. That's jazz. That's not pop. That's jazz. Also, another example of Ringo's off-kilter drumming, which you could hear previously on Anna from their debut. That being said, the chorus isn't great, and the middle eight is particularly lazy. Still, what's that chord doing here?<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">All My Loving</strong><br>Pop perfection. Lennon did an interview where he hinted that he was still upset Paul'd written it and he hadn't, although he also was awfully proud of his rhythm guitar work on the track, where he's playing in 6/8 against the rest of the song's 4/4. The chorus is genius, with its minor-augmented-major progression, as was the decision to bring the verse back in with Paul doing harmony instead of unison.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Don't Bother Me</strong><br>Hey, George gets a composition in! About time. This one's extremely underrated, and from a harmonic perspective, it's pretty damn strange. The song starts in D, then shifts to E, where you'd think it'd stay. But it then jumps to B. The shimmering chorus, with its not-even-a-little-friendly lyrics, is in a completely different mode (Dorian) from the rest of the track (Aeolian). You'd think the melody in the verse would go B-A-G-Gb-E. But he plays F instead of Gb, and it sounds straaaaange (adding a brand new mode, Phrygian). Mind you, do I think George was writing this song knowing all of that? Not really. Was anybody else accidentally throwing the rules of harmony to the wind in pop music? Um, no. Nope.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Little Child</strong><br>Finally, finally they drop a dud. I say dud; it's not terrible, but it's not great either. Just yer average not even two minutes rock-n-roll track they'd do on their first few albums. But this near-throwaway hides a neat little fact, and the beginning of the era of Captain Play Any Instrument: that's Paul on piano.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Till There Was You</strong><br>Man, I love this track. I can see why one wouldn't, as it's pretty schmaltzy, but I've played it a bunch of times on piano in a tempo closer to Guaraldi's rendition of ""O Tannenbaum"" and it kills. But it IS a cover of a song from The Music Man, so, y'know, it can't be that cool. Still, I love the chords to death. Also, how about George's solo? Pretty damn good. And that chord he ends on... God, I've spent days trying to figure out what that chord is. In tab from low E to high E, it's 242355. As a chord, I've seen it written as C7/9, but I'm pretty sure it's a Gb7#9. I <em class=""rymfmt"">think</em>. And he nailed the whole solo, with hyper obtuse jazz chord intact, at the Jubilee performance.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Mister Postman</strong><br>Eh. Really, really, really average. It's a decent cover of a track with the old doo wop I-vi-IV-V progression, which doesn't feel like it belongs on a Beatles track. It's also called the 50s progression for a reason: it's all anyone ever did then. Elton John brought it back for Crocodile Rock, but fuck that song. Sorry, moving on.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Roll Over Beethoven</strong><br>Hey, a damn good cover. And another great George vocal. His solo on this track ends with a rather chaotic run that's as refreshing as it is sloppy. Also, Ringo is beating the SHIT out of those hi-hats. And hey, rather than taking a Chuck Berry track and renaming it Surfin' USA as composed by Brian Wilson, they actually, um, credit it to Chuck.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Hold Me Tight</strong><br>Poor. I don't think any of the Beatles liked this track, not even McCartney. Written in 1961, and it shows. Moving on.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">You Really Got A Hold On Me</strong><br>Another cover, this one's solid if not spectacular. Has an unusual George/John lead vocal, and some rudimentary piano from Mr. Martin. Apparently Smokey liked it. I think it's just OK.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I Wanna Be Your Man</strong><br>Stupid, but endearingly rowdy. I love Ringo's drumming on this one, along with the sus6 harmony on the end of the chorus they'd first done on She Loves You. Still, they gave it to the Stones because they didn't think it was that good, and it's... well, it's not awful, but it's seriously insubstantial.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Devil in Her Heart</strong><br>Ok, this track and the next one, I flat out don't know anything about. I must have heard them at some point or other, but I have no recollection of doing so. Be back in five.<br><br>HOO boy, now I remember why I didn't remember it: it's about as gripping as shit flung at a wall. Thought it's a cover. But man, it has no business being here. Even George's vocal sucks.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Not a Second Time</strong><br>Also not particularly remarkable, featuring more rudimentary piano from Mr. Martin (if Paul could play as well as he does on Little Child, I have no idea why they brought George in to play piano at all, but oh well) and, oddly, no George Harrison. He's not on the track at all.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Money</strong><br>Okay, now we're back on track. This is one of the best covers these guys ever did, ever. It still kicks ass. I vividly remember trying to learn the piano part (played by Mr. Martin again, and not at all rudimentary this time around) at the age of like, 14 or something, and not being good enough to play it with both hands. Then I found out George overdubbed the left hand bit on top of the right hand bit. I was pretty pissed off. But anyway, a killer, KILLER closer.<br><br>Overall notes:<br>Too many covers, but their originals are improving dramatically. Most, anyway. It's a more diverse, polished set of songs in contrast to Please Please Me, but then they actually had time to write these in the studio, whereas their debut was just ""the songs we've been playing live for a few years now"" committed to tape. We've got George's first ""I'm a songwriter too, y'know"" moment, and sadly he wouldn't get another until Help. Ringo gets a better track to sing this time around, although John and Paul still aren't gonna write anything worth a damn for him to sing yet. Also, it's only thirty seconds longer than their debut, but it feels longer. And for me, an album feeling longer than it is isn't a good thing. Still, strides have been made.<br><br>Preferred version: Mono, <em class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles in Mono</em> 2009<br>review finished at 6:40 pm</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Right off the bat - <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> doesn't <em class=""rymfmt"">quite</em> measure up to the barrage of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, although individual moments are definitely knockouts as good as anything they were doing around this time. Besides, overwhelming momentum isn't so much the point of the record. What <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> is, is a modest step forward, as they play around a bit with arrangements. They add a Diddley beat here (""I Wanna Be Your Man"" which is the traditional ""Ringo song"" and blows ""Boys"" out of the water), put a little Latin flavor there (""All I Have To Do"" maybe an answer to <a title=""[Artist5549]"" href=""/artist/the_everly_brothers"" class=""artist"">The Everly Brothers</a>' ""All I Have To Do Is Dream"" but still first rate), and let their 50s rock influences shine through a bit more (""Roll Over Beethoven,"" which is good but doesn't touch the original).<br><br>Oh yeah, they've developed a better taste in covers. <a title=""[Artist7086]"" href=""/artist/smokey-robinson"" class=""artist"">Smokey Robinson</a>'s ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me"" gets a little extra muscle and an even better key. ""Please Mister Postman"" holds its own with <a title=""[Artist5180]"" href=""/artist/the-marvelettes"" class=""artist"">The Marvelettes</a>' original with ease, and the sticky-sweetness of ""Till There Was You"" is given a great, wide-eyed, cutie pie delivery by Paul McCartney. <br><br>The lows on this record are more obvious. ""Hold Me Tight"" was described later by McCartney as ""a work song,"" and pop ain't much good if it sounds workmanlike. Elsewhere, we get quite a few songs that feel like a meh take on ground previously covered on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, with diminishing results (the record is dragging a bit by the time the vapid ""Not A Second Time"" rolls around). They even repeat their trick of closing the album with a raucous rock number, in this case ""Money (That's What I Want)"" which is a prime cut, to be certain, and one of their best early numbers, but it doesn't feel like the huge climax in the context of the album quite like ""Twist And Shout"" did. <br><br>""All My Loving"" is pretty great though, and a hell of a good candidate if you and a long-distance significant other need ""a song."" The delivery of Paul's vocal makes it even better, eschewing the urgency for a solemn longing. George Harrison does really well for his first big composition on record, ""Don't Bother Me,"" which has a somber mood that stands out in a big way amongst what was still mostly typical young love stories from Lennon and McCartney. <br><br>This album eventually mutated into <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet The Beatles</em>, one of their many bastardized American releases, and basically conquered the USA. So this is as notable as a nucleus for that little piece of history as its content, but a lot of it is great content, with some rollicking favorites that keep the album afloat amongst the occasional pedestrian stuff.</span>"

Additionally, <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet the Beatles!</em> contains the great Beatles singles of early 1964, including the legendary ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""/""I Saw Her Standing There"" and ""All My Loving."" This album, not <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em>, is the one that changed history forever, marking the beginning of the British invasion and the burgeoning of the classic Beatles records. <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet the Beatles!</em> is solid, timeless, and full of intense energy and wistful longing, innocent love and reckless dancing. This album, not <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles,</em> hints at the potential of the greatest band of all time, fully showcases their songwriting skills and vocal talent, and allows as the title suggests for listeners to get a fantastic first impression of the fab four at their inception. <br><br>This album is not just an American issue of a British album; the two are so unbelievably different that, like night and day, they are forever unmistakable for the other in terms of quality at every level. <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet the Beatles!</em> is the classic that <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> could never be; it should be considered as such. It is the great introduction, a testament (like the UK version of <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>) to the Beatles' genius as songwriters at their earliest stages of pop hit making. Simply one of the greatest, most influential, and enjoyable albums ever made.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Quickly following up a successor to their chart busting debut, WITH THE BEATLES was released only eight months later and succeeded in knocking their own “Please Please Me” off the number one position on the charts. The Fab Four were on fire and the world was eating it up big time. Unlike the debut which was recorded in one day, this album had the luxury of taking three months to record although the music is very similar to the previous one that being mostly based on late 50s / early 60s pop. This album boasts 8 originals and 6 covers. There are a few firsts here for THE BEATLES. George Harrison makes his debut as a contributing member as singer and songwriter on “Don't Bother Me.” The track “All My Loving” was the first song ever heard by Americans when they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show which launched Beatlemania in the USA. Also it was their first album to sell a million copies in the UK. The second album ever to do so. <br><br>For me I like this second release better than the first simply because I like most of the songs on here unlike the debut. The originals are catchy and show how THE BEATLES were masters of their game in the simplified days before they got all freaky and creative on the world. The harmonies are sublime and the music is marvelous. The covers are good choices that add to their sound and an air of confidence is taking root. This is not the band reinventing their sound just quite yet but simply a slightly improved take on what they had been doing throughout the early 60s, namely pumping out some of the best pop rock music of that era. The band was still a few albums away from their best output but as with the debut I find this a mandatory piece in my collection for it is beautifully crafted and charmingly catchy hooks and was a minor step up in THE BEATLES' decade long career.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Solid rock n' roll album, especially for a sophomore album. ""Til There Was You"" is a bit saccharine for me, but it's an outlier on an otherwise mostly rocking album. ""It Won't Be Long"", ""Please Mister Postman"" and ""Roll Over Beethoven"" are favorites.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Grade: A-<br><br>After the huge impact of ""Please Please Me"", the Beatles immediately went to work on the next album, ""With The Beatles"". The Beatles pick up right where they left off on this preceding album. The harmonious, ""It Won't Be Long"", starts the album off with a bang, and could have been single. ""All I've Got To Do"" is an achingly gorgeous ballad, and is the other song here that should have been released as single. The perky, ""All My Loving"", is the best and most remembered song here, and it was the first song the band performed in America. ""Don't Bother"", is the first time we get to see George Harrison's bright potential, and ""Not A Second Time"", boasts some great harmonies. Yes, ""With The Beatles"" may lack the masterpieces that first album churned out, and because of that ""Please Please Me"" will go down as the better album. However, taken as a whole, this album seems a lot more structured and cohesive than the first, even the covers are improved on this time around. This album deserves more credit than it gets. <br><br>Choice Tracks: It Won't Be Long, All I've Got To Do, All My Loving, Don't Bother Me</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Продвигаемся дальше по альбомам ""Битлов"". <br>За что я люблю ранних Битлов - в них 90% песен которые меня абсолютно не напрягают. Это не значит, что проходных ""наполнителей"" здесь нет. Просто альбом в целом слушается приятно. За что я не люблю ранних Битлов - за то, что за частую я не могу сложить четкого мнения о некоторых песнях. Как правило я могу выделить парочку песен, которые мне определенно нравятся, парочку абсолютно шлаковых, а вот все остальное... Оно как то не то чтобы провисает, оно как раз ни туда и ни  сюда. <br>Все разведенная мною демагогия полностью касается и этого раннего альбома. Превосходные «It Won’t Be Long» и «All My Loving». Крепкие «Roll Over Beethoven» и  «Hold Me Tight», Ерундовые  «Little Child» и «Till There Was You». Со всем остальным оно  сложнее. <br>Начнем с более простого из оставшегося -  четкие тройки из оставшихся я поставил только «Money (That’s What I Want)» и «I Wanna Be Your Man». Все остальные же висели между 3 и 3.5 В конечном счете из оставшися 6 песен 3.5 поставил только «Please Mr. Postman», хотя с остальными четко  таки даже и не определился. Для меня это скорее тройки, но иногда и эти тройки могут попасть в очень нужное настроение. <br> Вот именно за это я не люблю и люблю одновременно ранних ""Битлов"".<br>Что касается в целом самого альбома, несмотря на такую же оценку как и первой их пластинке, могу сказать что мне не хватило немного гибкости оценок сайта. Дело в том что если первый чуть не дотягивает до трех, то этот чуть-чуть выше трех. А вот если их сложить и поделить на два, то получится ровная тройка. В любом случае хочу сказать что это хороший альбом и слушаю я его с удовольствием и в зависимости от попадания этих 6 песен иногда чуть с меньшим, а иногда чуть с большим.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Often confused with the American release of a similar name.... This Album already shows a major advancement in the groups songwriting, the types of instruments used, and the creation of the early Beatle ""sound"". My favorite tracks from this album are the covers of American ""R&amp;B"" songs, some of which are not included, oddly enough on the American version of the LP.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Вторая пластинка коллектива под простым названием «With The Beatles» (я бы перевел «С нами, с Битлами») вышла спустя всего полгода после первой. Обложка представляет собой черно-белую фотографию участников в одинаковых черных свитерах и без тени улыбки на лице. В целом уровень остался прежним, хотя, по мне, альбом несколько хуже дебютника, но он все равно возглавил национальный хит-парад. Снова половину занимают каверы, причем они на этот раз в основном поинтереснее собственных композиций ребят. Есть здесь лиричная «Till There Was You» (из мюзикла 1957 г. «The Music Man») с испанским оттенком, задорная «Please Mr. Postman» (снова песня из репертуара женской группы – на этот раз The Marvelettes), хитовый рок-н-ролл «Roll Over Beethoven» (в их исполнении ставший еще известнее, чем в исполнении Чака Берри), соул «You Really Got a Hold on Me» (из репертуара The Miracles), исполненная латиноамериканского влияния «Devil in Her Heart» (вновь от женской группы – The Donays»; ну, нравился ребятам женский рок-н-ролл) и хит «Money (That’s All I Want)» (как и в случае с «Twist and Shout», эту вещь запомнили именно благодаря «Битлам»). Что касается песен собственно «Битлов», то Леннон выдал энергичную «It Won’t Be Long» (с отличным припевом и игрой слов «be long» и «belong»), балладу «All I’ve Got to Do», интересную «Not a Second Time» (с несколько тревожным фортепьяно), Маккартни – полные задора и романтики «All My Loving» и «Hold Me Tight», а Харрисон (да, даже он) – минорную «Don’t Bother Me» (с интересным рисунком ударных). Интересно звучит совместная продукция от Джона и Пола – «Little Child» (в духе Rolling Stones, с солирующей гармоникой) и задорный рок-н-ролл «I Wanna Be Your Man» (также в стиле Rolling Stones и для них, впервые исполненный ими же; говорят, после этого «Роллинги» так вдохновились, что сами решили писать песни). The Beatles продолжали двигаться вперед, но пока кроме любви других тем не затрагивали. Впрочем, о чем еще писать песни молодым парням, как не о любви?<br><br>Рецензия написана 20 марта 2005 года</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Take the problems with <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, multiply them by a thousand, and congratulations! You have <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>! There are some songs I like here. The first three songs are all great. ""You Really Got A Hold On Me"" is a good cover. ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" is pretty fun for its inoffensive two minutes. But, that's about it. The originals feel rushed (I'm thinking ""Little Child"" and ""Hold Me Tight""), the covers are often hokey and dated as all hell (definitely ""Till There Was You"" and ""Devil In Her Heart""), and this is all-around an inconsistent release from a band that could do better.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Only four months after the release of their debut album “Please, Please Me” The Beatles went to the studio again to record their sophomore album “With the Beatles”. This album once again featured many covers by Rock N’ Roll and Blues artists. 6 of the thirteen songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney and “Don’t Bother Me” is the first composition by guitarist George Harrison. <br><br>I am not biggest fan of the band’s debut album and I consider this album as a huge step forward from “Please Please Me”. Some of the songs are more on the rock side, I like that and also the vocal harmonies are sounding better on this LP than on their debut. <br>“With the Beatles” is not one of the best studio LPs the Beatles ever recorded but it’s a decent record with some great tracks.<br><br>My favorite tunes are the catchy opener “Ii Won’t Be Long” and “You Really Got a Hold on Me”, both of these track feature great vocal harmonies. Other cool tracks are “All I’ve Got to Do”, “All My Loving”, the catchy “Please Mr. Postman”, the rocking “Hold Me Tight” and also the George Harrison composition “Don’t Bother Me” is a cool track. The remaining tracks are decent but nothing special.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I feel this is one of those cases where a second album is rushed to capitalize on the success of the first, and to me it's really weak for the Beatles (though still not terrible). To me the only really good song here is All my loving.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I didn't like this group much in 1963, few American males did. I thought they were a little wimpy. BUT the ladies loved them so any self respecting high school male had to pretend to like their effeminate light weight rock. Of course, my attitude about their music changed big time over time.<br><br>RIP  George Harrison<br>RIP  John Lennon</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles wasted no time following up their debut, releasing ""With The Beatles"" within months of ""Please Please Me"".  For me, both records are very similar, although I feel ""Please, Please Me"" is a better record. ""With The Beatles"" has a bit of a rushed feel to it, with a large chunk of the record comprising of pure Rock N Roll covers and you wonder how much time the band were given to really get their own creativity going.  The bands first two records really only show hints of the seizmic shifts that this band would cause artistically and culturally and you wonder if we can only see these hints now thanks to hindsight. That said ""With The Beatles"" throws us tracks such as ""It Wont Be Long"" and ""All My Loving"" which stand out from the crowd in a big way. The bands version of ""Money"" closes the record in spectacular style.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">""With The Beatles"" is similar in many ways to ""Please Please Me"", though was less rushed in production, and so the result is that the songs are more consistent and solidly created, though much of the live, raw energetic appeal is lost as a result. There are a few brilliant tracks found at the start, but the quality wanes greatly as the album goes on. The covers here are far less memorable or inspired, and the quality of performing is not nearly as strong as on their debut.<br><br>The album has its flaws, but still contains many a great tune on it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Oh la douche froide ! Après l’excellent premier album, je pensais que ça irait en s’améliorant, mais en fait non.<br><br>C’est la même recette : quelques reprises plus ou moins passionnantes, des paroles encore ciblées pour adolescentes vierges, des titres courts et pourtant répétitifs et ennuyeux… Je sens que je ne vais pas revenir souvent sur cet album !<br><br>On a heureusement quand même quelques bonnes chansons qui trainent. D’ailleurs, j’aime bien leur façon de composer : une intro percutante (on s’embête pas avec des accords pleins pendant une heure, c’est pas plus mal) puis une accélération pour le passage au refrain.  C’est flagrant sur « All I’ve got to do », le meilleur titre de ce second album.<br><br>Ma conclusion sera donc la même que pour le premier album mais pas pour les mêmes raisons : vivement la suite. Ça sent quand même un peu la facilité, là !</span>"

"<span itemprop=""description"">More than a few really good tracks (""Please Mister Postman"", ""Money"", ""Roll Over Bethoven"", ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All My Loving"") filled with average and sometimes boring songs like ""Till There Was You"" (I just can't stand this one).

Again it starts pretty well, slips quite a bit, and has a fairly strong ending to the A-side. <br><br>The B-side starts with a cover of the Chuck Berry song ""Roll Over Beethoven"". I think it's a decent cover, and is one of the most uptempo songs on the album. In all honesty, the B-side is generally all OK, with no real stand-out tracks but some decent songs. ""Money"" is a very good track, though. One thing about The Beatles' early albums is that, for all their shortcomings, the best tracks were placed at the beginnings and ends, to try to strengthen people's opinions of the albums, and I guess it worked to an extent.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Highlights:</strong> It Won't Be Long; All My Loving; Please Mr Postman; Roll Over Beethoven; Money<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Verdict:</strong> An average album that has a couple of decent tracks and a fair amount of filler.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Rating: </strong>7/10</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Wat valt er nog allemaal te vertellen over The Beatles? Het was een fenomeen dat van in het begin de popwereld op zijn kop zette. Deze With The Beatles is uitgebracht amper een half jaar na hun debuut Please Please Me en werd een gigantisch succes hoewel het op een kleine week tijd is opgenomen. Zovele jaren na datum klinkt het album nog steeds even opwindend, fris en vrolijk als toen. De covers komen vooral uit het repertoire van het Motown-label (Please Mister Postman, You Really Got A Hold On Me, Money), maar ook de rock’n rollklassieker Roll Over Beethoven van Chuck Berry krijgt een eerbare Beatles-behandeling. Van de eigen nummers blijven vooral I Wanna Be Your Man, It Won’t Be Long en Little Child bij dankzij de boeiende arrangementen en de opwindende stemmen van John Lennon of Paul McCartney. En… niet vergeten, ook hier deed George Harrison zijn duit al in het zakje door zelf ook één nummer te schrijven. Het zou een gewoonte worden.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I love this Beatles album! Call me mad, but from sheer enjoyment alone I'd would personally choose this over some of their more acclaimed albums like ""The White Album"" or ""Rubber Soul"". OK I can concede from an artistic point of view it's not breaking any boundaries, but It's just that simple rock 'n' roll sound that I can really dig. Man the vocals here are brilliant; John in particular is at the top of his game. The covers are cleverly selected and while the majority of original tracks are all love songs it's still a very fun and catchy album. I love the chorus in Don't Bother Me and Little Child. Listen to how they sing ""I'm so sad and lonely, baby take a chance with me"". It's pure gold! It's a feel-good album and I don't think there are that many Beatles albums which makes me want to sing along to every track like this one. <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt""><span style=""color:red;"">Album Rating:</span></strong> 81/100</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A bit thin sound in the production, but the songmaterial is good, again including own songs as well as some covers. Vocal harmonies are being worked on, and they work rather much better here than on ""Please, please me"". <br><br>The band's sound is also much cleaner and some songs have quite polished vocals, where others have the similar ""harshness"" in the vocals as the debut. The music on this album gets the joy of playing transferred into the mood of the listener, and hence the album is a nice cheer up album as well.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The second Beatles album still marks the Beatles in slightly shaky early territory but marks an exponential improvement from their debut and displays a great deal of growth.    The mood is mostly lighthearted, playful, and fun, making for a very enjoyable romp of an album.     Everything sounds less dated than their debut album and the band's sound is clearly approaching the well-honed brilliance that would soon emerge.   <br><br>There are still a great deal of covers but they are better selections for the Beatles than some of the cheesy stuff on their debut, and some of the album's best moments are covers - Lennon's passionate performance on ""Please Mister Postman,"" Ringo's explosively energetic ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" (written by Lennon and McCartney but first recorded by the Rolling Stones), and the group's fantastic harmonies on ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me"" are highlights.    <br><br>The originals are generally strong as well.   Most are love songs with a sense of innocence (especially compared to music and culture today) and fun.    A few tunes are awkward and forgettable.    Nonetheless this is a great addition to the Beatles discography and a recommended album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Second Beatles album within a year and slightly weaker than their debut, containing more fillers. Once again, half of the album consists of the original material and other half are the covers. Apart from usual Lennon/McCartney penned material,  George Harrison contributed his first song, ""Don´t Bother Me"", which is solid, not the best, but certainly not the worst out of the original songs. First three songs are the strongest ones on the album IMO, starting with merseybeat rocker, ""It Won´t Be Long"", with nice backing vocals, ""All I´ve Got to Do"" is slower, with little rhythm &amp; blues influence thrown in, ""All My Loving""  is my favorite here, gentle love song with some nice country styled guitar work. Ringo got to sing on ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", showing that he is complete musician with more than a solid vocal. <br><br>Cover songs  were once again mix of traditional pop, rock and roll, girl group sound and rhythm &amp; blues/soul, but overall covers were much better executioned on Please Please Me. ""Til There Was You"" is highlight here, nice acoustic ballad with bongos and Paul´s smooth vocals, it stands above rest of the songs, especially Chuck Berry´s ""Roll Over Beethoven"", which they kind of butchered, mainly in vocal department. <br><br>With the Beatles is a little step backwards in contrast to debut album, but since this was their second album within a year, not to mention singles outside the records, this is stil solid piece of work.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">A hasty second effort from the four lads from Liverpool with more covers (and more generic ones at that) than their first album is not a step forward for the Beatles by any means. This album's main problem is in its marketing: girls girls girls. This album offers very little for the male demographic. Every song is just whining about some lass making me blue or making me cry all night. Can we get a little more ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and less ""Don't Bother Me"" for God's sake? That is, more rock 'n' roll a la Chuck Berry, fewer covers of The Shirelles.<br><br>The other huge drawback is the cover choices. One, they really expose the band's songwriting inexperience. At this point, people like Smokey Robinson and even Berry Gordy could still outwrite John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and it shows with every drab original that comes down the line--""All I've Got to Do,"" ""Don't Bother Me,"" ""Hold Me Tight,"" ""Not a Second Time""--all crap, and I would not miss them were they forever expunged from the Lennon/McCartney and Harrison catalogs. Not only are the covers superior in quality to the originals, but they are very, very generic. I suppose you could argue that the Beatles, recording this in 1963, got to them before their British counterparts, but the fact is, the British Invasion was for all intents and purposes a feeding-frenzy of British eye candy with suspect actual musical talent recycling the pop songs American blacks had difficulty selling to white audiences. ""Please Mister Postman,"" ""You Really Got a Hold on Me,"" and ""Money,"" for examples, were absolutely picked clean by cover artists in the '60s, British or otherwise.<br><br>Still, the performances are respectable. I maintain that some of John Lennon's finest work--vocally, at least--came during the earliest stages of the Beatles.<br><br>At a time when it seemed like the Beatles could do no wrong; like they could sell a million recordings of themselves making fart noises with their armpits, one must take notice that this album contained zero #1 hit singles. Consider that <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is the <strong class=""rymfmt"">only</strong> Beatles album with this characteristic until 1965's <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> (only three years, but a LOT of albums later), and this is a big deal. Yes, it still hit no.1 on the albums chart, but going from song to song on this sophomore effort, you can really see that the Fab Four missed the mark on this one. A mulligan perhaps; they'd set things right soon enough, as history confirms.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Update 3/24/2015</strong>: I think the above review from two years ago contains many valid points made in defense of my initial distaste for this record. That said, I have to disagree with some of it upon further review. First, the Beatles originals here, though not catalysts for the imminent musical revolution the Beatles would help lead in a few years' time, are pretty good. I mean, ""It Won't Be Long"" and ""All My Lovin'"" are classics. I explicitly berated ""All I've Got to Do"" above, but I shouldn't have; it's a good song. The covers, though, yes, very unmanly are, for the most part, handled well. It's hard to mess up Smokey Robinson's ""You Really Got a Hold On Me"" and Paul knocks ""'Til There Was You"" straight outta the ballpark, for examples. <br><br>I still believe <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> was a step back from a very promising debut, but not a dangerous or egregious one. <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>, after all, turned out to be alright.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">All the great songs are packed at the beginning, with the flawless I Want to Hold Your Hand as opener.<br>I should be giving this at least a 4 with that in mind - but the rest of the tracks after It Won't Be Long are straight 3 stars, so alas.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Artistic merit very closely approaches 0. Again, the argument I see on this review page is: ""it's really not very good, but it's the Beatles so it must be good."" Yeah, well, I'll let those statements stand for themselves. <br><br>It's boring and mindless and all of the fun (though to be clear, mindless) songs are lifted from black artists who did it better. Wedding / bar mitzvah music.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Mere af det samme fra albummet før (popopopop og en gang Chuck Berry-inspiration indimellem), men ikke på samme niveau; nul superhits og lidt for mange deciderede missere.. faktisk det dårligste album i deres diskografi.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Das zweite Album der Beatles folgt ganz dem Strickmuster ihres Erstlings, allerdings ohne den ansteckenden Schwung und Enthusiasmus und dafür glatter produziert. Vom Songwriting her kann ich hier keine wesentlichen Fortschritte ausmachen -- außer vielleicht, wenn man so will, das schräge Klaviersolo in ""Not a Second Time"". Interessant auch, dass der Gesang bei ""Devil in Her Heart"" mich extrem an jamaikanischen Rocksteady erinnert. Insgesamt klingt das Album für mich aber wie eine lahmere, zahmere Version des Erstlings, dessen Enthusiasmus und Energie ich hier doch ein wenig vermisse.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The next step in the Beatlemania evolution. A personal favourite of mine, with rhythmic and uncompromising beat music ('It Won't Be Long', 'Don't Bother Me', 'I Wanna Be Your Man'), fine melodic and well-thought-out love songs (All I've Got to Do', 'All My Loving', 'Hold Me Tight') and absolute fantastic cover interpretations of well-known motown hits from The Marvelettes ('Please Mister Postman'), The Miracles ('You Really Got a Hold on Me') and Barrett Strong ('Money (That's What I Want)'). The iconic album sleeve cover by Robert Freeman with the four head shots of the band members, framed in turtleneck sweaters and captured in a perfect interplay of light and shadow, became world famous and often copied, since it first appeared.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Nearly as corporate and contrived as the first Monkees record. Not much variation thematically or in song structure, but they are good at what they do.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I've come to realise 1963's pop and rock music was so shitty that by comparison, With the Beatles looks like it's been sent by God himself.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">The second Beatles album is pretty much a remake of the first one, plus a slicker production, minus the punkish primeval energy -- quite a step down for this kind of music, in my opinion!<br><br>Especially the A side feels quite generic, formulaic and uninspired. Thankfully, the B side is better, with a few fun foot top inducing rockers (""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""Hold Me Tight"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", ""Money""). For those looking for songwriting advances, there are some latin rhythm elements and a weird piano on ""Not a Second Time"", but otherwise...<br><br>While I really enjoyed the Beatles' first, this one left my pretty cold. Yes it's a pleasant listen, but it doesn't really leave any other impression than that.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Could be a great album for any other classic rock band but for the guys who recorded ""Please Please Me"" it's kinda dull.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Solid. ""Money"" is probably my favorite.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Similar to the Beatles' first album. The only difference is the originals aren't quite as good and the covers are not quite as good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> is a much lesser inspired album than <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. What lacks here are real highlights, not to mention that the last songs are really bad, but in their <strong class=""rymfmt"">Merseybeat</strong> period <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> were still searching for great melodies, in all truth finding them rather rarely. <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Overall: 2.45</strong></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Still riddled with a couple of cover versions and soupy songs that were obviously aimed at the ""parent generation"", <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is nevertheless a huge step forward for the band. Their own compositions and their playing is a lot tighter, and the material overall more cohesive. Even though the album contains none of the band's hit singles from the time, ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All I've Got to Do"" and ""All My Loving"" are very strong, and George Harrison's debut as a composer ""Don't Bother Me"" is simply stunning. They're still possibly a bit too young for real depth, but the readiness to attack compensates for some of the album's shortcomings, best exemplified on the impressive if not totally successful ""Money"". In those days, the Beatles were more about attitude than craft, and the attitude is certainly right.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Probably the only Beatles album where the cover versions are the best tracks on the albums, not that the Lennon/McCartney songs are throwaways, 'All My Loving'?!  but this is such a fascinating insight into the roots and influence of the band.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles never made a bad album, not even close to one. Such standards being set, one does incline to lean towards less than loving feelings after the needle leaves the groove of their sophomore adventures. George's first opportunity to dazzle 'Don't Bother Me' is for what it's its worth a rather glum dour affair, lacking John's smug satirical bite or Paul's happy go lucky glass half full goofiness. Of the 18,000 covers 'You Really Got a Hold on Me' and 'Til There Was You' are lovable little scamps, boys almost as misty eyed as the girls after the first, the second may have had more than a little insistence from Sgt. Major Martin, but those twisted arms were soon forgiven as Paul really does appear to love every second of it. 'All My Loving' never fails to demonstrate just how good Macca was when it came to proper pop music. Delightful. The Beatles and run of the mill filler though, does that exist? Yes it does, 'With the Beatles' surrendering timidly to average efforts like 'Hold Me Tight' and 'Not a Second Time'</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">A tiny teeny step above their great debut.<br>A nice follow up which ties nicely to their first album.<br>The rock seems to take a step up with a tad more intensity, and the love songs are still as wonderful as ever.<br>Gotta love how they give Ringo a song to sing...again.<br>It's The Beatles.<br>Nice tight rock, pop, and ballads for your enjoyment.<br><br>9.0 A-</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No filler! I couldn't believe it! ALL the songs are great!!!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Paul McCartney has said that the early albums were meant to sell and were made for their teenage girl fans. And it's true, but what makes ""With The Beatles"" timeless is a combination of the guys' distinctive talent and their undeniable charisma. I really can't love this album more! The claim that the early Beatles were nothing but a boy band is so wrong on so many levels. Yes, their music was light, but they made and wrote their own songs, from lyrics to the instruments they used.<br><br>Favourite songs: ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All I've Got To Do"", ""Don't Bother Me"" (it's actually my favourite song from the album, Harrison is amazing!) and the cover ""You Really Got A Hold On Me""<br><br>Fillers: probably Devil In Her Heart</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">With The Beatles offers stagnation and progress in equal portions. The Beatles are able to diversify their sound a little - check out the easy listening ballad You've Really Got a Hold On Me or the acoustic Till There Was You - but these dabblings, whilst outside their comfort zone, weren't exactly innovative. In the rock sphere, however, the delivery is noticably improved. All My Loving and Hold Me Tight are highlights of the album, and the more relaxed recording sessions and superior studio equipment improve the sound quality appreciably. If anything, the weakest point on this album is the lyrics, which remain mired in cliche, though Not A Second Time does take things in a darker than usual direction.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Recorded at a time when the idea was no doubt to just get something out there before the whole ""mania"" thing fizzled, this is pretty damn good.  John Lennon especially, as he squarely positions himself as the rocker of the band.  And while Paul does the same as the ""mellow"" Beatle, his ballads on here are pretty weak.  The excellent ""All My Loving"" not withstanding. The addition of a Broadway standard like ""Till There Was You"" is a pretty good indication that this group had not found a real solid direction.  ""It Won't Be Long"" jumps right off the record with a great lead vocal from Lennon.  ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" is a perfect Ringo vehicle, and ""Money"" has John ripping it up at the end, just like he did on ""Twist and Shout"" on the debut album.  The harmonies are also coming together very, very nicely by this stage.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Straight up off-key caterwauling. What were they thinking?</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The American lps that contain this music are the first lps I ever purchased, way back in 1964. I still listen to and enjoy this music, so I guess it has stood the test of time, at least with me. Here, for whatever they are worth, are some opinions:<br><br>1. Both Meet the Beatles and The Beatles Second album are better than this lp and easily rate 5 stars with me. The original UK issues (""as the Beatles intended"" and all that) are not always better than the American lps.<br><br>2. How many rock groups from this era (or any era) could put three Motown covers on an album and, arguably, equal or better the originals? I love Motown, but for my money the Beatles beat the originals on all three of these tracks.<br><br>3. The other covers are a mixed bag. Roll Over Beethoven is strangely lifeless. Some of their live performances of this song easily beat this version. Till There Was You is really a charming performance, but it seems out of place.<br><br>4. The quality of the Lennon/McCartney compositions is a bit of a drop off from those on the first album. The only classic here is All My Loving, and Little Child and I Wanna Be Your Man are throwaways, although the former is saved by a strong performance. Neither Ringo or the Stones could do much with I Wanna Be Your Man though. Unlike many people, I like Hold Me Tight, and George didn't equal Don't Bother Me for quite some time. <br><br>5. The whole seems a little better than the sum of the parts to me. The lp is sequenced well and is a good listen from beginning to end.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I enjoy this album quite a lot. This is probably my favorite early Beatles album. Yeah they hadn't made the jump into their better years, but as far as their early songs, besides the singles the best ones are here. All My Loving is just awesome and is the standout track here. It Won't Be Long is about as good, and so is I Wanna Be Your Man. Till There Was You is probably the most interesting track and I really love what they did with it. All around a really amazing album.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">With the right mix of originals and covers, the Beatles delight, seduce and deliver on this, their most hard-rock record.  We find Johnny Rebel, Romantic Paulie, Mystic George and Ringo the lovable joker Rock Hard with Humor ready to conquer America.  As 1963 turned into 1964, the Civil Rights movement took hold and the Beatles were the soundtrack to America's Revival.  The Beatles said Yes to joy, love and rock &amp; roll and they did it with resounding joy, panache and flair.  America was ready for the Fab Four and Rock listened with new ears! <br><br>Track Picks-It Won't Be Long, All My Loving, Don't Bother Me, Roll Over Beethoven, You Really Got a Hold on Me, I Wanna Be Your Man, <br>Not a Second Time and Money (That's What I Want).<br><br>Beatles Forever!-Knock It Back!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Listen to Please Please Me and then listen to this. As great as their debut was (which started the 60's, you might say), their sophomore album is even better, with more sophisticated compositions, and improved musicianship. It comes through with a harder edge too, and like PPM, it ends with a solid raver. It basically fits in with the other four albums that comprise their first five, just in style and song selection, and if you're looking for solid rock and roll from the early 60's, those five albums are it (sure there are other quality artists, but none of them had anywhere near the level of impact that The Beatles had).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Convertidos en un fenómeno internacional, The Beatles se veían obligados a volver a entrar al estudio pocos meses después de haber sacado su debut.

You Really Got a Hold on Me, Roll over Beethoven (works really well with George's scouse accent), Please Mister Postman, Devil in her heart, Money and Till There Was You. All the R&amp;B tunes are infused with raw emotion (There's a point on You Really Got a.. which just kills you inside in a good way).<br><br>My personal low point of this LP is probably Hold Me Tight. Sure its kind of fun but it just sounds like it should be on their previous LP. I also wasnt too keen on Not a Second Time but it was ok<br><br>My Top 5:<br>1. It Wont Be Long.<br>2. All My Loving<br>3. You Really Got a Hold on Me.<br>4. All Ive Got to Do<br>5. Please Mister Postman.<br><br>Overall, there isnt really a song on here that i didnt enjoy listening to, but i enjoyed some more than others. The vocals are a lot more emotional than their previous release with some really nice harmonies (All My Loving final verse) and the covers are a lot better. So, that's why i give this 4 and a half stars</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No hay demasiado para decir de este disco. Tal vez baste con copiar y pegar la introducción de Please please me para describirlo. Son iguales, y lo único que los diferencia es que los temas son otros y sus nombres también. Se distingue un aire un poco más rockero, pero estilísticamente nada cambia, todo es juvenil, fresco y en ocasiones rocanrolero.<br>  Vamos, beatlemaníacos, admitan que es un disco mediocre. Los Beatles se limitaron a seguir haciendo lo mismo para vender todavía más y seguir siendo el furor del momento.<br><br>  El disco empieza muy alegre con <strong class=""rymfmt"">It won’t belong</strong>, un pop con coritos hermosos y melodías pegadizas.<br>  Sigue All I’ve got to do, una balada intrascendente. Melodías poco destacables y coros típicos, que son los que los levantan el nivel del tema, se escuchan.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">All my loving</strong> es muy buena, tiene coros excelentes, melodías románticas y alegres, y el primer solo de George destacable en la historia de los Beatles.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt""> Don’t bother</strong> me se presenta adormecente, y continúa así hasta el final. Horrible. Un bongo monótono que no hace otra cosa que aburrirme (aunque en realidad todo en este tema lo hace) se escucha de fondo, tocado soezmente.<br>  Continuando mediocre, el disco presenta<strong class=""rymfmt""> Little child</strong>, que al principio no parece ser tan malo. Pero todo es muy repetitivo, cosa que hace que el tema no se salve de la marca de lowlight.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Till there was you</strong> es el primer cover del disco, una linda balada acústica y fresca. George mejora bastante tocando la guitarra en este disco, y en este tema se nota cuando se escucha su solo del medio.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Please mister postman </strong>es insoportable. Me cansa sobremanera el coro del estribillo, y ni hablar de la melodía irritante de las estrofas, que encima se repite no sé cuantas veces.<br>  Roll over Beethoven es un tributo al rock and roll de los 50, que por más que tenga melodías bastante disfrutables y un estribillo muy bueno, se hace repetitivo y cansa.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Hold me tight</strong> es otro pop con una guitarra bastante distorsionada de fondo, que tiene muy buenos coros pero que, como muchos otros, se vuelve monótono. Escuchando este tema nos damos cuenta de lo genérico que puede ser Ringo.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">You really got to hold on me</strong> es una balada lenta con melodías buenas y coros destacables que está a un paso de ser lowlight, pero que es salvada por los cortes del medio.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">I wanna be your man</strong> es otro rock and roll ligero tontamente cantado por Ringo, monótono y execrable, sobre todo en las estrofas.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Devil in her heart</strong> es otro cover intrascendente, que poco ofrece para comentar. Disfrutable, nada más.<br>  Se escucha<strong class=""rymfmt""> Not a second time</strong> ofreciendo unas lindas melodías y un solo de piano de Martin tocado espantosa e inexpresivamente.<br>  El disco se despide con <strong class=""rymfmt"">Money</strong>, un número bastante blusero y movido con unos pegadizos coritos de fondo y con un Lennon con voz quebrada.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Puntuación: 6-<br><br>Mejor tema: All my loving<br><br>Highlights:</strong> It won't belong; All my loving; Till there was you.<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Lowlights:</strong> Don't bother me; Little child; Please mister postman; Hold me tight; I wanna be your man.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Anche per quest'album potrei utilizzare la stessa formula che ho usato per Please Please Me:<br>Può sembrare banale, stupido, ecc...<br>Ma...hey, siamo nel '63!<br>Comunque questo è anche meglio del primo.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">El segundo disco de la banda de Liverpool sigue en una línea similar a la de su debut: canciones sencillas de rhtym&amp;blues, pop y rock´n´roll. Ya hay algún ""temazo"" (de los que pasan a la historia) como ""All My Loving"" o ""Please Mister Postman"".</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A logical next step up from ""Please Please Me"". This album is so full of good songs that it's better than most band's ""Greatest Hits"" albums. To name all the great songs on here would take up too damn much space so I will just name the major standout tracks, ""All My Loving""and four cover tunes, ""Please Mister Postman"", ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""You've Really Got A Hold On Me"", and ""Money"". The Beatles make these songs completely their own. The rest of the album is spectacular as well but I'm not going to name all the songs on it. What I will do is name the closest thing the album has to a bad song, ""Till There Was You"", and that song isn't all that bad at all. Even the Ringo(""I Wanna Be Your Man"") and George(""Don't Bother Me"") tracks are great. A must have for any fan of good old rock and roll. Try it, you'll like it.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">With the Beatles is really the definition of a filler album, over half the songs are covers, the original songs are a bit forgettable and feel a bit lifeless compared to the original songs on their first album. But then again that was the problem with the British invasion, so many British invasion bands were basing their careers on covering popular American rock n roll and R&amp;B songs from that era and it really held a lot of bands back from doing anything really innovative or exploring their songwriting potential. Look at the Stones, they didn't really start lifting off until Out of Our Heads when they started to focus on their original songs over the cover, and here the Beatles were really just following trends to make a name for themselves and break through to the American audience, which wouldn't happen until a year later, although the songs that charted were originals, their covers had pretty little success aside from Twist and Shout.<br><br>The thing is what makes Please Please Me a stronger album than this since Please Please Me also relied on its cover songs heavily. The problem is it just feels like less production was put into the album, the covers feel a bit lifeless, especially the Motown ones, You Really Got a Hold on Me feels like it goes on forever when its just barely under 3 minutes. Please Mister Postman is alright but doesn't come anywhere close to touching the Marvelettes original. Roll Over Beethoven is catchy but again pales in comparison to the original. The only cover on this I found to be somewhat captivating is Money, which sort of brings a faster beat and a bit more life to the song than the original. Also Till There was You was an odd choice, even if the guitar work is pretty nice, its the Beatles doing a song from Music Man, I mean thats like if the Stones did a song from Sound of Music. <br><br>Now for the original songs, all I can say is rushed production and a young band trying to find a place in the British invasion where most bands were playing similar styles to appeal to a specific audience. All I've Got to Do just sounds a bit dull and is totally forgettable, one of the few Beatles songs I actually have trouble recalling, Little Child is a fun little filler song, but is nothing special really, Hold Me Tight is just a messy generic rock n roll song that even Paul said was a pretty awful song. To be honest All My Loving is really the only outstanding song on this album, it has a similar vibe to She Loves You and great harmonies with a nice guitar solo, it was one of those great early British invasion pop moments. It Won't Be Long is a pretty energetic opener but compared to some of the other Beatles albums, is pretty insignificant, in fact its my least favorite Beatles album opener aside from Rubber Soul, although not to say its still a pretty catchy song. Also I Wanna Be Your Man is a solid song considering Ringo sang lead vocals. It has a cool rhythm to it and shows Ringo evolving as a drummer, he was actually pretty underrated as a drummer and people overlook him. <br><br>So overall, With the Beatles is an alright album and being a huge Beatles fan, I can't really hate this, but I do understand it being pretty insignificant and forgettable when comparing it to the band's entire career, and it is one of their worst albums, but in all fairness it doesn't quite sink as low as Beatles for Sale in terms of bland/forgettable cover songs. About half the songs on this album work for me, but outside of All My Loving, this isn't anything I'd place above any of the other albums British invasion bands were releasing during this time.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Too many covers and just a couple of inspired songs by Lennon &amp; McCartney make this only a mediocre album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">After the great success of the first album, Fab Four created yet the next one in the same year. This fourteen songs are at a level where today's bands are dream about. Especially, first side of this album is fantastic, fresh and lovely and shows how genius they were. On the second side we can hear the little lower level but covers like Money or Roll Over Beethoven don't stand out from the songs from the first side. This is the masterpiece of pop music. Pop which means rhythm, melodic and ability to write beautiful, energetic songs for everyone. As we learn later, the definition of Pop is changed by them and several other artists. Now, we enjoy this music and we smiling like a kids. That's great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In mono this is easily a classic. The ratings are extremely low for one of the best albums of all time, tsk tsk</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In retrospect it could perhaps be seen that the Beatles second album suffered through a bit of a sophomore slump or a backwards step in their musical progress, but at the time of its release this album satiated quite well the growing hunger in Great Britain for more and more new Beatles music. And while ""With The Beatles"" plays like a cleaner and a more leisurely made carbon copy of their first album ""Please Please Me"", the Beatles second album is not without its own lyrical and melodic growth, it's own brand of firsts and its inevitable introduction into creative studio innovations.<br><br>As a songwriting team, Lennon and McCartney were coming up with new singles to bridge the gap between album releases. They hit high on the charts in the Spring with ""From Me To You"", they blasted the charts in the late summer with ""She Loves You"", but still their adoring fans clamored for more. Had they held those two killer singles along with their b-sides for their second album, not to mention their current single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and <br>This Boy"", there's no doubt their album would have received much more success, both critically and in record sales.<br><br>As it would turn out, Lennon and McCartney were not the only budding songwriters within the group at this point, this album also saw the first original composition from George Harrison, a song titled ""Don't Bother Me"".<br><br>The group started the album by cashing in on their recent success with ""She Loves You"" by trying to duplicate in the chorus of ""It Won't Be Long"" with the same ringing 'Yeah, yeah, yeah's' that had become their musical trademark that summer. The song features outstanding backing vocals and it also captures the spirit of early Beatlemania better than any other song on the record, with the possible exception of ""Little Child"".<br><br>One of better songs on the record is McCartney's ""All My Loving"". Though lyrically simple, the song works primarily because of its quick step rhythmic movement through each of the plain verses only to stop suddenly before launching into its even simpler and steady driving chorus. Lennon's searing rhythm guitar propels the song along, while McCartney's playful baseline hops over and into the beats. It's deceptively genius. And as always, the boys deliver top notch backing vocals while Paul shows off his chops in the higher register near the end of the song.<br><br>The covers on the album follow the same recipe as their first record. Paul attempts to better ""A Taste of Honey"" by singing ""Till There Was You"". Now I understand that most people hate this track and that they don't feel it fits well on the record and that it totally fucks up FM Rock stations that play The Beatles A-Z weekends, but hear me out: Paul gives his absolute best vocal on this track and George's guitar work, especially the solo are great, better than anything any pop group was doing at the time. Granted, it does feel a tad out of place, but upon further inspection I think that you'll see how much this song kicks ass. Paul may have originally ""Saw Her Standing There"" on their first record, but here on their second record he never ""SAWER THEM AT ALL, TILL THERE WAS YOU"".<br><br>The other rock and soul covers are good, with the exception of ""Devil In Her Heart"", which I see as this album's weakest spot, that and the Lennon and McCartney original ""Not a Second Time"".<br><br>And just like the first record, this record closes with a Lennon song that kicks major ass. It's not quite the ass kicking of ""Twist and Shout"", but then again, what is? But for all of its own glory, the Lennon cover of ""Money"" showcases that Lennon had at this point, and I would also add, for a long time to come, the best voice in rock. No one could scream like Lennon, and this song is adequate proof of that.<br><br>I really don't see this album as a backwards step or a sophomore slump. However, I could see it as a sort of side step, not a lot of musical growth, but they were finding themselves and they were able to deliver top music at a frantic pace, so that is a kind of growth, they were adapting to the world they were making. I guess I could say that the album ""With The Beatles"" does not live up to the stratospheric cool of the album cover, but that album cover is one of the best covers of all time.<br><br>Hey, deal with it everybody...the Beatles were fucking great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Astounding amount of energy radiating from this record. Please Mister Postman is such an awesome cover and is one of my all time favorite songs by The Beatles (even if not originally by them). John Lennon has the perfect voice to make it happen. The rest of the songs are great, too, but PMP is just one of those that I listen to the album for. It Won't Be Long is a nice opener.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Un disco de igual nivel que su anterior trabajo, pero posee la diferencia de que comienzan a aparecer mas momentos de rock e himnos que harian bailar a una generacion que nacia. I Wanna Be Your Man, es uno de los mejores temas cantados por Ringo, Don`t Bother Me no se queda atras y de un nivel mas elevado estan temas como It Won`t Be Long o You Really Got A Hold On Me, y todo termina en Money, otro de sus poderosos cierres.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Getting better...<br>Confident enough to opt for a mould-breaking album sleeve, the quality of the first three songs alone tells you they've come down the road apiece since the debut set ""Please Please Me"" all of eight months earlier.<br>""It Won't Be Long"" is an urgent opener, ""All I've Got To Do"", a plaintive but unsentimental ballad while McCartney's instant classic ""All My Loving"" flows fresh as a mountain stream.<br>George's first songwriting effort ""Don't Bother Me"" hardly hints at the riches to come but motors into the consciousness all the same.<br>Of the covers, the best are the three Motown takes, all sung by Lennon, distinctive and respectful in equal measure. <br>Unfortunately Paul gets to sing a show-tune again and Ringo criminally neuters ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", almost insulting the Stones altogether tougher version.<br>The rest is hit and miss pop, Lennon's mordant ""Not A Second Time"" perhaps the best of them, but on balance this album is certainly a portent of things to come and don't forget the little matter of the four high quality singles also released in the same calendar year. This album, unlike its predecessor, contained no singles. Imagine swapping one or two of the lesser lights here with the likes of ""She Loves You"" or ""I Want To Hold Your Hand""...</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Según muchos, este segundo disco es un paso adelante respecto al primero. Yo no lo veo así, para mí están los dos a la misma altura, e incluso prefiero <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> más que nada por su mayor frescura y, sobre todo, porque <strong class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</strong> tiene un lado A muy bueno, pero en la segunda parte baja abruptamente de calidad, y se hace cansador escucharlo entero, mientras que <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> está mejor secuenciado. <br>Fuera de eso, es un álbum disfrutable, los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> seguian haciendo baladas románticas pero en éste álbum se nota una ligera inclinación hacia el rock and roll, haciéndolo un disco más enérgico que <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. <br>Todavía hay muchos covers, pero son muy buenas baladas románticas y la mayoría de los covers se lucen (al menos más que en Beatles For Sale). <br>El álbum empieza muy bien con una gran primer mitad. <strong class=""rymfmt"">It Won't Be Long</strong> abre el disco de manera furibunda, con esos irresistibles ""It won't be long yeah"", en la que es probablemente la mejor canción del disco, honor que comparte con la canción más famosa del CD, <strong class=""rymfmt"">All My Loving</strong>, con una letra extremadamente tonta y cursi, pero una melodía exquisita, que sólo provoca deleite. En el medio está <strong class=""rymfmt"">All I've Got To Do</strong>, una buena canción, no hay mucho que decir sobre ella. <br>Luego llega la primera composición de George, <strong class=""rymfmt"">Don't Bother Me</strong>, y la verdad es que le sale muy bien, con una canción melancólica en su letra y en el uso de acordes menores, otro highlight del álbum. <br>Luego viene <strong class=""rymfmt"">Little Child</strong>, una canción estúpida, la línea ""I'm so sad and lonely"" es seductora y brillante, pero  no la aprovechan y hacen una canción pedestre que es uno de los puntos bajos del álbum. <br>Afortunadamente todo se redime con <strong class=""rymfmt"">Till There Was You</strong>, el mejor cover del álbum, un bolero con unos tintes acústicos hermosos y unos sobrecogedores bongós de Ringo, que es el último highlight del álbum. <br>La primera mitad cierra con <strong class=""rymfmt"">Please Mr. Postman</strong>, una canción alegre y divertida pero no muy brillante. <br>La segunda parte es floja. El punto más rescatable es el excelente rock and roll <strong class=""rymfmt"">Roll Over Beethoven</strong>, con esa introducción clásica de guitarra que la hacen el punto destacado de esta segunda mitad, aunque es inferior que los puntos altos de la primera. <br>Hay también un original, <strong class=""rymfmt"">Hold Me Tight</strong>, que es la peor canción de todas (junto con Little Child), con una melodía perezosa y una letra irritante. <br>Luego hay tres baladas de piano que nunca alcanzo a distinguir bien cuál es cuál. La mejor es <strong class=""rymfmt"">You Really Got A Hold On Me</strong>, con unos muy buenos pianos jazzeros. <strong class=""rymfmt"">Devil In Her Heart es un cover aceptable</strong>, mientras que <strong class=""rymfmt"">Not A Second Time</strong> es la peor de las tres, pero tiene un puente melódico disfrutable que la salva de irse a la basura. <br>Hay un original que es un rock and roll genérico con una melodía mediocre y repetitiva pero que es ciertamente disfrutable y muy bailabe como <strong class=""rymfmt"">I Wanna Be Your Man</strong>, y el cierre lo da <strong class=""rymfmt"">Money</strong>, con unos dignisímos arreglos de piano que la hacen otro punto ciertamente disfrutable. Un 7+<br>Highlights: It Won't Be Long, All My Loving, Don't Bother Me, Till There Was You, Roll Over Beethoven<br>Lowlights: Little Child, Hold Me Tight</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Exactly seven months after their ""Please Please Me,"" the Beatles released this second studio album. On the surface, ""With the Beatles"" is quite similar to its predecessor; both records consist of 14 tracks, feature 6 covers of trendy American soul, last right around 32 minutes and contain fairly straight-forward pop. The differences, however, are in the subtleties, and with this album the Beatles took a number of small steps toward expanding their sound. Perhaps I'm just under the influence of the album cover and its more serious, black and white aesthetic (although a band as image conscious as the Beatles would have surely agreed to this with a reason), but the album as a whole strikes me as somewhat edgier than the debut, right from the layered ""Yeah yeahs"" that begin ""It Won't Be Long."" True, the original songs are still all about love and chasing girls, but this time Lennon and Harrison hit notes of longing and heartache far more convincingly. McCartney's more conservative pop sensibilities seem to keep him from following in the same direction, but ""All My Loving"" is a good song with some very nice guitar playing and ""Till There Was You,"" although serving a similar purpose, is a far superior cover to the first album's ""A Taste of Honey."" ""With The Beatles"" therefore sees the band stay firmly within the limited confines of Beatlemania Merseybeat, but nonetheless making noticeable and enjoyable improvements in tone and songwriting.<br><br>Highlights: ""It Won't Be Long,"" ""Don't Bother Me,"" ""Not a Second Time""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A good early Beatles album. Has some great ones on here that I heard a lot back when I was young; so a lot of it is very nostalgic for me. My faves on here are ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All my Loving"" and the cover of ""Please Mister Postman"". <br>You gotta love the stereo recording; instruments on the left and vocals on the right. It sucks if either side of your speaker system is damaged. Great stuff.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Some great singles...mixed in with weak bsides.  The rockers rock and the ballads are weak.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is the band's second release with the Parlophone label. It's not a bad follow up.<br><br>Many people complain that this is their worst, or at least one of their worst releases. I disagree. While not my favorite, I must say that <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is probably one of my favorites from their early period. Many reviews in magazines and on websites cite the fact that the album is ridden with covers. <br>First of all, I think the covers give the album some charm. I don't love all of them. For example, ""Devil in Her Heart,"" an American B-side, doesn't really showcase the Beatles talent. Yes, George Harrison sings fine on it, but to me, it's missing the energy that they were so good at producing.<br>I love their version of Chuck Berry's ""Roll Over Beethoven."" The production quality (granted it was recorded almost five years earlier, in an era when recording techniques were constantly improving) is much more solid and full.<br><br>There are eight originals, one of them being George Harrison's first composition. ""Don't Bother Me"" was written while Harrison was sick in bed. It's not the greatest song in the world, but for soon to be twenty-one year old Harrison, it was a good first attempt.<br><br>The standout McCartney track is ""All My Loving."" John Lennon's rapid fire triplet playing really makes the song. Usually, Lennon's rhythm style is chunky; almost playing like he wanted to damage the instrument. (I think this was fantastic for the band, by the way) Instead, he used his first of two tiny Rickenbacker 325's, and uncharacteristically plays the chords quite cleanly, showcasing the Rickenbacker's trademark ring.<br><br>Lennon's standout track, to me is ""It Won't Be Long."" It's catchy, and was originally set to be the single. It was passed on when ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" was written in order to appeal to the American market.<br><br>Ringo gets his usual cut and this time it's an original. It's a modest rocker, written simply for Ringo's limited vocal range. ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" was eventually given to the Rolling Stones.<br><br>Compared with <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me,</em> it's a little better. The production quality jumps quite a bit. It's a bit more polished, and while I usually tend towards favoring a less polished production, something about this one gives at a little edge over its older brother.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is a very decent second release.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Ce disque dévoile d’indéniables progrès, en matière de consistance et dans l’affirmation plus perceptible des personnalités artistiques distinctes de Lennon et McCartney. Si aucun de ces titres ne fait l’objet d’un 45tours, l’effort demeure le plus solide et enthousiasmant de la première période du groupe. Toujours très imprégnés d’une musique américaine qu’ils revitalisent, les Beatles sont sur le point de conquérir les États-Unis.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Starts off with a bang, but seriously under-performs in the meat of the record. Their cover of ""Money"" is fucking fab, though.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Another great collection of originals like ""It Won't Be Long"", ""Hold Me Tight"" and covers like ""Please Mister Postman"" and ""Money"".</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Even when relatively average by their standards they are still amazingly good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">À la fois ridicule, honteux, mauvais et irrésistible, l'album contient tout de même neuf chansons dangereusement inoubliables...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Basically just a beefier more muscular version of Please Please Me, which I suppose ain't sayin' as much as you might think it would. It's actually a really frustrating record honestly mostly because it fucking teases you. It wouldn't probably have teased people in 63' of course who wouldn't have gone and been let down by not getting something they wouldn't have hoped for in the first place. Which is more and more originals. It's got the same ratio of originals to covers as the debut did, and having the same amount of tracks too! What it does do that Please Me didn't is blow it's load like an overexcited teenager. Which is where the teasing comes in. See you start this thing and it's right into greatness, the first bunch of songs are great and fresh for the most part! Aside from All I've Got To Do (which still sounds like the boys staying in the shadow of their idols) they sound like...BEATLES. They sound fresh and forward looking, they sound potential filled. It gets you pumped and ready for more greatness later on, after all Please Please Me had it's two best songs right in the middle. But alas this does not occur. Instead the album suddenly gets swamped in the covers for awhile then on again off again in the final third as pretty mediocre originals surface to bother you. Suffice to say....you do not encounter anything like Love Me Do or the previous album's title track. Strong start and a sudden drop. I understand that there's things that just worked differently back then, like the way singles were done for instance. People didn't see a reason to put strong singles onto albums, but I'm sayin'. Just imagine some of the 63' singles on here! From Me to You? She Loves You? I Want to Hold Your Hand? Them killers? Even just one of them would have been fine. But really just more original material would be fine, since even the covers here lack the spark the covers on the debut had (don't expect any Twist and Shouts). And that sucks because well...that's what made the covers tolerable before. Now I just want them fucking gone! At no point were The Beatles a band that needed to play other people's hits. They already had their own. But see that's the thing about The Beatles, when I get frustrated with other bands I usually know my advice isn't taken on the next record. Not...with these guys.<br><br>Rating: 3<br>Highlights: It Won't Be Long, All I've Got to Do, All My Loving, Don't Bother Me</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's probably shocking to younger generations how something fairly insubstantial sounding as this is considered a classic. The historical value sure does help. Their songs would later become a lot more diverse and distinguished than this.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">We can tell this album was only made for teenage girls. Although it has some nice covers such as ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""Money"". Otherwise, this album may not appeal to you.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No preamble here, Lennon launches into the opening call and response chorus of It Won't Be Long in the highest of spirits. The verses are punctuated by Harrison's downward guitar runs and the counter-point backing vocals almost get in the way but Lennon's performance is indomitable, so much so that he's not ashamed to claim the next song too, All I've Got To Do, with its broken verses and plaintive cries anticipating the melodramatic refrein. McCartney hits back with the irrepressible All My Loving with its unusual 12 to the bar strum and a little country break. These three gems promise great things but, unfortunately, side one stalls at this point even if Harrison's Don't Bother Me is curiously down-beat. Little Child has Lennon imitating Buddy Holly and the soppy Til There Was You has McCartney affecting an Irish accent. Lennon puts in another good performance on Please Mr Postman to close side one but Harrison is a little out of his depth on Roll Over Beethoven. These cover versions might have been exciting at the time, and some of them still are, but in the context of what The Beatles went on to achieve, in hindsight, they seem like filler and rarely hold the interest the way the best of the originals do. Hold Me Tight is just so much more fun than You've Really Got A Hold On Me despite McCartney's ridiculous vocal. I Want To Be Your Man may be slight but Devil In Her Heart is completely disposable. It's up to the rather convoluted Not A Second Time to rescue the end of the album, it transcends the simplistic form beat music represented and renders the likes of Money (That's What I Want) more and more unnecessary.<br>The Beatles were riding high and couldn't put a foot wrong even if this album isn't quite as good as their debut.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">""Remember I'll always be true""</em><br><br>While their early 'pop' material may not be as widely celebrated as their later 'rock' material, <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> is as big a highlight of their unparalleled career as <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album206]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/revolver-5/"" class=""album"">Revolver</a></em>, <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album8]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/the-beatles-white-album-4/"" class=""album"">The Beatles [White Album]</a></em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">insert name of <a title=""[Artist366973]"" href=""/artist/liam-gallagher-1"" class=""artist"">Liam Gallagher</a> approved obvious choice here</em>. What it does have that <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> later albums lack is a sense of enthusiasm and energy. This is the sound of four young men in mid ascent into the stratosphere.

Zajęło im to około dwóch miesięcy i już w listopadzie album był gotowy. Oczywiście powtórzył on sukces poprzednika i poszerzył grono fanów zespołu, a raczej kult, który zamienił się wówczas w tzw.

It took them about two months and in November the album was ready. Of course, he repeated the success of its predecessor and expanded the circle of fans, but rather a cult, which then turned into the so-called. Beatlemania. The album contains tracks of McCartney and Lennon and also seven covers, mostly from Motown.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">As per the usual with the early stuff...much of the Lennon/McCartney stuff is good, the covers are kind of a disappointment, and I'm mostly listening to hear their later sound develop.<br><br>On my iTunes:<br>""It Won't Be Long""<br>""All I've Got To Do""<br>""All My Loving""<br>""Don't Bother Me""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The follow up to ""please please me"" basically repeated the formula of the debut with a mix of covers and originals . Only this time the band had a bit more time to record it .<br><br>It's a mixed bag in all honesty , of the covers pauls croon through ""til there was you"" and the bands superb take on smokeys ""you really got a hold on me"" show this was a band who were like a veritable juke-box in their own right.  But the versions of ""please mr postman"" and ""roll over beethoven"" pale in comparison to the originals .<br><br>Of the originals ""it wont be long"" is a great opener with bursts of harmony and a nagging chorus , its just infectious in its energy . Ditto pauls ""all my loving"" which is easily the best track on the album which kind of belies that his songwriting was in johns shadows in the bands early days although john did kind of take over after this record. His own ""all i got to do "" is nice , a straight up impersonation of the miracles sound though .  ""hold me tight"" and ""not a second time"" are very ordinary ,clearly filler which leaves only a mention for georges ""dont bother me"" which is surprisingly decent for a first attempt at songwriting and has a different sound to the rest of the album . And then of course ""money"" which ends the record like ""twist and shout "" did , with a full tilt lennon vocal ,pounding drums and great backing from george and paul . <br><br>""with the beatles"" was really just a vehicle to harness to the bands growing fame and its OK but nowhere near as good a record as the following ""hard days night"".<br><br><br>The remastering does an excellent job here making the whole album sound punchy and immediate.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">at least in terms of major breakthroughs in songwriting, but I'll be damned if that rhythm section didn't improve and Martin and co didn't make leaps in the production dept.<br><br>This is an album I always derided, mainly because the Mono version kind of highlights the fact that as songwriters John/Paul kind of went on a sophomore slump to a degree (at least on the album, as the singles IWTHYH, She Loves You, etc were top notch) and it kind of does what mono does best (at least in the pre Psych Beatles version of mono bring up the voices, tone down the backbeat)....<br><br>Well as such this not very stellar (but hardly bad, and great compared to the pop competition of the day) album was kind of a goose egg for the Beatles cannon (a 2.5-3 star album).<br><br>Well on 09-09-09 the stereo remaster came out, and wow does it pop, perhaps my favorite of the early beatles stereo versions from the remaster (the mono remaster for this album still doesn't do as much), bouncy songs like Hold Me Tight, Beethoven, Devil in her Heart, that to me were frustratingly bland in the old, are now fun (though not great--Beethoven is nearly ruined by a terrible vocal by George, whereas Tight/Heart kind of meander in the old, but have a sheen on the remaster--and the stereo cuts musicianship pop (as does some cuts in Beethoven).<br><br>THis guy's a 3.5-4/5 in REMASTERED stereo.<br><br>As such my blended rates a 3.5/5.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Their worst album by far. Very inconsistent. ""All I've Got to Do"" is by a long shot the best song here.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Un passo indietro rispetto all'album di esordio (livello Beatles solo ""All My Loving"" e la cover di ""Roll Over Beethoven"").</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is the one. The one that made America fall in love with those pesky Beatles...Pretty much the US version of With the Beatles, only with some tracks shuffled out and the big single ""I Want to Hold Your Hand""/""I Saw Her Standing There"" landing on the album in their place. Unfortunately, my dollar copy of Meet the Beatles! is beat to shit and skips, and these are skips that even I can't fix with my 'technique'. Damn you 60's Beatles addicts! How the fuck do you get stoned to ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""All My Loving"" anyway? TELL ME!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Side A:<br><br>3.5 - Highlights include ""It Won't Be Long"" and, obviously, ""All My Loving"".<br><br>Side B:<br><br>3.0 - Highlights include ""You Really Got A Hold On Me"", ""Not A Second Time"" and ""Money (That's What I Want)"". The others songs, however, are some of the shitiest songs ever by The Beatles.<br><br>Final:<br><br>3.5 - Not as balanced as ""Please Please Me"", but in the same level of quality.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles' second album is similar to the first in that it contains eight original tracks and six covers, although they're weighted a bit oddly - the first five songs are all originals, which means we only get three more of them in the final nine.<br><br>Putting that to one side, there's much to like here, although I don't think as much leaps out as it did on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>.  Of the Beatles-penned tracks, ""All My Loving"" is an obvious classic (fans of the Australian seventies/eighties TV programme ""Young Talent Time"" might recognise it as the song Johnny Young used to sing, ballad-style, when closing each show, while the kids 'oohh-oohed' in the background as they said goodnight to each other), while I also have a soft spot for ""I Wanna Be Your Man"".  Like on ""Boys"" (from <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Me</em>), there's something about Ringo's hollow/raw vocals that I just find captivating.  But, for me, the standout original is George Harrison's haunting debut, ""Don't Bother Me"". It wasn't to be the last exceptional Beatles piece he would pen and perform.<br><br>Of the covers... eehhh, I'm not in love with too many of them.  Paul sings beautifully on ""'Till There Was You"", and ""Please Mr Postman"" is pretty rousing, but I've never been much of a Chuck Berry fan, so ""Roll Over Beethoven"" does little for me.  <br><br>The best of these songs is ""Money.""<br><br>I love ""Money"".  Well, I don't mean I love <em class=""rymfmt"">money</em> (although I do like it - it's rather important), but this song is a knockout, and another one that takes me back to my childhood. It was a 45"" single my parents had, and not only would I play it over and over at home, I even took it into my Grade Seven class in 1980, and they were bowled over by it too.   At the time, this was rock to me. Hey, it still is. I love it, no-one screams better than John, and it finishes off this album in style.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Ez a bemutatkozó lemeznél is gyengébb; általában ugyanaz a stílus, csak a szöveg különösen agyhalott és a dalok is általában laposabbak.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is my least favorite album from them, and while there are some really fun tracks on this, there are also the bad. It Won't Be Long, and All My Loving are really the only originals that stand out here. Some of the covers are good with  Please Mister Postman, Roll Over Beethoven, You Really Got a Hold on Me, and Money. These covers really salvage the album from some pretty weak Lennon/McCartney tracks.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It should be noted for collecting purposes, that the image shown of this album, which contains green lettering of the name ""Beatles!"", is the second pressing. The first had brown lettering, like the image for the mono entry.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I think of this album most fondly for the song I remember playing on the radio while my mother ironed in the kitchen when I was four years old - ""All My Loving."" Otherwise, this is an ok album (how they had more musical notoriety than the Stones at this point in their careers is beyond me). Even the recent 2009 remasters couldn't improve this one much from a sound perspective. I'd say for fans only (yes, I know, all 300 million of them).

I have never before understood why ""All My Loving"" is so big (and especially it has always been big in my country, I don't know why). Up to this, ""It Won't Be Long"" has sounded like a killer opening to me, ""All I've Got to Do"" has been slightly less essential and ""All My Loving"" again a bit less essential. This time it went the same way until ""All My Loving"", which suddenly sounded excellent. A revelation! Possibly the sound improvement has done something to the song, or is it me? I don't know. ""Not a Second Time"" and ""Little Child"" sound surprisingly valid as well.

John Lennon shows how rhythm guitar should be done with the quickly strummed triplets.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's hard not to peg ""Meet The Beatles"" as a five star record, especially considering that in America it was the Beatles biggest selling pop album from that year, but really, it is basically just a slick variation of ""With The Beatles"".

I was about 10, and it conquered me with just a single auditon. Ok, a 10 years old child's taste, isn't critically relevant at all, but 15 years later, I still find an energy, in this album, they hardly showed again. I'm sure melodies and harmonies improved progressively, until Abbey Road's climax. There are no miraculously records as ""A Day in the Life"" or ""Eleanor Rigby"", over here (although McCartney's ""All My Loving"" remains as his first ""Yesterday""), but with some exceptions, as later ""Helter Skelter"", they had never been so fierce, energic, young and bluesy, again! <br><br>With The Beatles aged, it was alredy old, 2 years after the original release, but it's still capable to produce a noise, as pleasent as their most important accomplishment, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which also aged tremendously (unlike Revolver) and wasn't so much more revolutionary: While Pepper's was the seminal concept album, expanding pop music limits, by erudite, free jazz, music hall and indian music elements incorporation, With the Beatles initially gave the Rolling Stones, one of their earliest hits, ""I Wanna Be Your Man"". It started Beatlemania in the US, through its inferior American version, called Meet The Beatles (2 songs performed by the quarted, in the Ed Sullivan Show, their first appearence on American TV, were also in the original British version), oppening all necessary doors, for the British Invasion phenomenon, which changed Rock and Roll forever. After that, Dylan got electric. Almost 30 years later, Kurt Cobain changed the face of music again, still influenced by this album, parodying the Ed Sullivan Show, in the ""In Bloom"" video clip. <br><br>With the Beatles is an essencial, underrated rock album that still rocks.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Really catchy, with a nice set of good songs (Roll Over Beethoven, Money, Please Mr. Postman).

This has grown on me so much in the past 5-10 years, I do rate it as one of this periods stand out tracks. Hats off George!</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>, released four months after <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> on 22nd November 1963, knocked that album from number #1 to claim its own spot there. While The Beatles continued to grow in popularity, the music on their second album followed a fairly similar style to their debut - 14 tracks, six of which are covers, and a simple beat/rock 'n' roll pattern. However, <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> did not contain any of that years hit singles - in fact the the album produced no singles for the band in the UK. Recorded in an extremely busy three-and-a-half months, The Beatles still managed to string a generous selection of decent tunes together, finishing the album (complete with a fine production quality) in October. Albeit a bit softer than their debut, <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> showcased just what The Beatles were capable of with other artist's tunes.<br><br>The album contains some of the best Beatles covers, most notably Smokey Robinson's R&amp;B hit ""You Really Got a Hold On Me"", which features Lennon and Harrison singing harmoniously together. On the other hand, I'm not too keen on The Beatles take of Barrett Strong's ""Money (That's What I Want)"" while ""Please Mister Postman"" snuggles in nicely but seems a little underdone compared to it's neighbours ""Till There Was You"" and a Chuck Berry cover ""Roll Over Beethoven"", brilliantly sung by Harrison. McCartney's take on the Broadway song ""Till There Was You"" is another fine example of how The Beatles have uplifted a song and crafted it with such passion that it become a leaf in their own book. <br><br>Talking about McCartney, he apparently penned a mental blueprint of ""All My Loving"" while shaving, working out a tune for it on a piano backstage while supporting Roy Orbison, and, for a song that was composed of individual idea bursts, it came together quite nicely to be my pick for the standout tune on the album. Harrison's ""Don't Bother Me"" may arouse some rumours of his 'gloominess', and if George hadn't of written another piece, one may have thought that was the case in this standard bittersweet take. The lead track, ""That Won't Be Long"" is Lennon's finest contribution to the album, the stormy thirty-two-bar tune being the proud bearer of one of the most inventive bridges in rock 'n' roll music at the time. Lyrically it also features Lennon's subtle obsession with word play, flirting between the words 'be long' or 'belong'. Harrison's handy work in the chorus of ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", sung by Starr, was another slice of inventive musicianship by The Beatles, the song being played tremoloed on an open E chord. ""All I've Got to Do"" is one of the earlier examples of the band's developing knack to write music with major-to-minor key transitions. The song itself is pretty boring though. <br><br>Unfortunately the album does suffer a little from the inclusion of standards ""Little Child"" which would have fitted nicely on <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> after the title track, and ""Hold Me Tight"", which features McCartney at his vocal and musical worst. I can't help but feel Lennon's dominance was enhanced by the quality of his original material on the album. <br><br>While the album beholds musical and technical improvement over its predecessor, the best of the Beatles early period records was to be released 8 months later, to a music community who just could not get enough of the 'Fab Four'.<br><br>7.1/10</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Less killers, more fillers, the singles are not as good and the fillers are more of a bore... yes, The Beatles did the first sophomore slump of pop with ""With the Beatles"". <br><br>Their second album uses the exactly same formula of the first (of course, since it was released only eight months after ""Please Please Me"", it is expected to be a bit formulaic). Again fourteen tracks, and again six of them are covers. The thing is, this time the cover versions are more engaging than their original songs, a clear sign of not having enough time for bright ideas. With that said, ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""Please Mister Postman"" are great pop tunes.<br><br>Not to say all of their original songs are bad; ""All My Loving"" and ""Hold Me Tight"" are highlights. But that's all: the other songs are not as fun, and it's good that they are short, so you dont feel bored by ""With the Beatles"" even with only fourt highlights out of fourteen songs. Still, this album is probably the worst of the twelve albums of The Beatles canon - which is just a testament to their greatness, as it really isn't such a bad album.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">It is almost impossible to review Beatles albums without going track by track because their albums are always full of brilliant tracks. But what makes it even harder is you have to divide the albums into their sections, John's, Paul's, and George's. <br><br>This being their second ACTUAL lp it was generously filled from front to back with tracks in a time where usual six to eight tracks were included on an album. <br><br>The originals on the album are a mixed bag really. Lennons' 'It Wont Be Long' is among the groups all time greatest and forgotten tracks. His signature wail is chilling, while the next 'All Ive Got To Do' is decent at best, though Harrison does play a great country twanged solo, sure to have influence the Byrds. Admittedly I am not a great Paul McCartney fan as I find him more fit for Broadway than rock n' roll, his 'All My Loving' is easily the strongest track on the album. 'Don't Bother Me' being the token Harrison track is also among the strongest. 'I Wanna Be Your Man' is classic early Beatles with Ringo on vocals and doing a stellar job at that, while 'Little Child' is a poor attempt at a Chuck Berry number, and 'Not A Second Time' may have been nice in 1964 but runs boring today. <br><br>As far as the covers, or 'personal selections' as they called them then they are all fantastic. 'Please Mister Postman' could rival that of 'Twist And Shout' as Lennons best vocal. 'Roll Over Beethoven' haunted Harrison and Lennon that they couldn't write something like it. 'You Really Got A Hold On Me' is almost better than the original Smokey Robinson version, and it sure is sung with more soul. 'Money' is decent however and could have been done better but is still pulled off thanks to Lennon.<br><br>With The Beatles is an early Beatles classic. They still hadn't found their niche and become comfortable with themselves but still pulled of a great rock n' roll record none the less.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like a lot of the Beatles' early work, the album kind of trails off on side B, but it's still very enjoyable pop with many, many classics.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">well, its not amazing.<br>and too many covers.<br>but i cant deny, the first half is pretty good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I like their later material better, I appreciate the moves in various artistic directions they took as the four members all grew and developed as artists, but at heart the Beatles were a pop group, plain and simple.  They were an amazing pop group too and it's really in their early work that they allow their pop capabilities to shine through most impressively.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Too many covers, and not enough original stuff. I do love their ""Please Mister Postman."" cover.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Even my least favorite Beatles album is still better than anything on the top 10 Billboard charts today.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not everything The Beatles did is timeless and incredible. Their early albums were the uninventive foothold required for their later greatness.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Moué bof......c'est comme les coups de pieds au derrière........on s'en passe........</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Although a few great Beatles songs can be found here, after the first three tracks the album quickly begins to spiral downward.  Most of the originals are sub-par, i.e. ""Little Child"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", and the six covers don't help, either. Although some are passable, none of them live up to the standards created by ""Twist and Shout"" on their previous effort. Overall, With the Beatles is a good EP's worth of songs bogged down by excessive filler and covers. In fact, it's surprising that the Beatles opted to leave off their recent singles; the inclusion of ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"", along with their B-sides, ""This Boy"" and ""I'll Get You"", could have easily replaced much of the filler.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">An ounce of darkness to dilute the pop happiness, and great melodies to boot.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Here we have the first Beatles release on Capitol Records. George Martin and the Beatles were against having their fans pay for the same songs twice (this got more relaxed in later years) so if a song was on a single, it wouldn't be used to sell an album. Capitol Records had the opposite view, which is why this album began with ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"". In Capitol's defense, it does make the album stronger. With little exceptions, this is an alternate version of ""With The Beatles"". This also has all Lennon/McCartney songs with two exceptions (a George Harrison composition and a song from the ""Music Man""). Not bad.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This album was a direct sequel to ""Please Please Me"" in more ways than one. Like it's predecessor we get some staples of the Beatles stage show and cover songs. We get a bit of Motown here, which isn't a bad thing at all. Also like it's predecessor we close with John Lennon belting out his lungs in a cover song. ""Money"" right up there with ""Twist and Shout"" as cover songs the Beatles brought some new life into. Lyrically though this is also like the album before it. Many of the lyrics are very simple and about dancing with girls. Still the way the songs are carried through, you might not notice the unoriginality at first, except when we get some fillers. Speaking lyrics, this album also has the first George Harrison composition in ""Don't Bother Me"". Hardly ""My Sweet Lord"", but not bad for it's time. The cover was taken by Robert Freeman, whose wife may or may not have inspired ""Norwegian Wood"", and definitely has the Astrid and Jurgen influence. It is one of the most iconic images of the group. The weak links are few and far in between though and this early Beatles album shows them as strong musicians improving with time.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This stands a hair below the debut. The covers on the first album are better than the covers here but I think the orginals here are better. Take a look at ""All I've Got to Do"" and marvel at how underrated it is. Look at some of these mostly ignored album tracks like ""Little Child"" and ""Not A Second Time"". Sure, this is one of their lesser albums in my mind but it is still great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A solid move forward from the debut, it would have been even stronger if they'd replaced a couple of covers with originals instead. My favorite tracks are the frenetic ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and the stark and moody ""Don't Bother Me"". Everything about this album finds The Beatles maturing - the tone, the lyrical content, even the album cover itself is deliberately adult. Still, like everything pre-Rubber Soul, it's overshadowed in hindsight by what would come later. But you can really hear the group nailing down aspects of what makes an album an ""album"", such as the way the opening track on side one is crafted to be an attention getter.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">People tend to be over excited whenever it comes to The Beatles and make excuses for their first albums. ""Oh, LP's weren't important back then, that's why it's inferior"" and still somehow manage to give it 5 stars. That approach is BS. Instead of actually rating the album based on the material within, they rate something like this recording based on the IDEA of The Beatles. ""The Beatles are the best band ever, therefore they can do no wrong"" kind of nonsense. Whether or not they are indeed the best band ever is disputable, though they do make a good claim with their later works (though not NEARLY as definitively as most would lead you to believe).<br><br>I suppose what I'm trying to say is that we should all take some advice from Public Enemy and ""Don't Believe the Hype."" The Beatles were great, but they weren't always great every second of their lives and let this album, with it's weak-ass versions of ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""Money"" (the whole second half is pretty poor, come to think of it), be evidence of that.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Easily the Fab Four's weakest album. Apart from the superb ""All My Loving"", there aren't any truly good songs on here. ""It Won't Be Long"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" and ""Money"" are all fun, but the amount of boring rock n roll covers really makes this a chore to listen to in one sitting. <br><br>Still, it was a fairly rushed recording and showed the Beatles early in their career without the experimentation they became known for.</span>"

The album starts strong with the high-energy “It Won’t be Long,” followed by the very pretty “All I’ve Got to Do” and the classic “All My Loving.” The are without a doubt the best three songs on the album. Of the 14 tracks on the album, six are covers, and of them only the very last, “Money,” does anything special for me. The others are fine, but they just seem rather unnecessary. I would have much prefered to hear the singles which are notably absent from the album (”She Loves You” and “I Want to Hold Your Hand”) than The Beatles doing “Please Mister Postman” or “Roll Over Beethoven”.<br><br>Reading about the frenzied context in which this was released, I can certainly appreciate its cultural significance and how influential it was. For my personal tastes, The Beatles don’t get all that interesting until a few albums later. But there’s no doubt that they were amazing songwriters from the start.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Edit (07.02.2016): changing rating from 3* to 3.5*, adding review.<br><br>Very enjoyable collection of silly little love songs.

"<span itemprop=""description"">A very enjoyable album through the first five or six tracks, then my patience starts to wear thin with all the covers and filler.  The pairing of ""Please Mister Postman"" followed by ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is particularly trying.  The highlights of the album are George Harrison's ""Don't Bother Me"" along with the two slower John Lennon songs ""All I've Got to Do"" and ""Not a Second Time.""  And of course the album's most famous track ""All My Loving.""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Да, у Битлз были проходные пластинки! Мне здесь нравится только три песни: ""All My Loving"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", и ""Till There Was You"". Последнюю вообще написал чувак по фамилии Уилсон, а не Леннон и не Маккартни. Остальные песни - незапоминающийся филлер и шлак. Зато обложка очень крутая.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">LA PREHISTORIA DE TODO LO QUE SE PUEDE ESCUCHAR AHORA. MATERIAL ARQUEOLÓGICO.

The covers have been thrown away, and instead, this is pure Lennon–McCartney–Harrison stuff. Of course there is ""Till There Was You"", but that is a nice performance. The main problem for me is the opening track and smash hit, ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" I have never considered it an essential song or recording.<br><br>Anyway, <em class=""rymfmt"">Meet the Beatles!</em> contains ""This Boy"", ""It Won't Be Long"" and ""All I've Got to Do"" that are more than rough diamonds, plus the slightly lesser gems ""I Saw Her Standing There"", ""Don't Bother Me"", ""Little Child"" and ""Hold Me Tight."" I have sometimes treated ""All My Loving"" as a slightly useless mock-classic, but within this set of songs I noticed that I really enjoyed the listening.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Au moment ou j'écris ces lignes, cet album et le précédent ont exactement la même note moyenne sur le site. Je n'en suis pas étonné car ces deux disques sont de même acabit.<br><br>Le nouveau matériel regorge de morceaux accrocheurs : ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All My Loving"", ""Hold Me Tight"", ""I Wanna Be Your Man"", toutes redoutables d'efficacité. Harrisson propose ""Don't Bother Me"" qui reste un cran en dessous. Les reprises sont également bien senties avec ""Roll Over Beethoven"", ""Devil in Her Heart"" et la chaloupée ""Till There Was You"" sur laquelle McCartney fait une jolie prestation. ""Money"" joue ici exactement le même rôle que ""Twist ans Shout"" dans l'album de début.<br><br>C'est un disque plein d'entrain et de fraîcheur dans la même lignée que le premier. On sent qu'ils en veulent!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is my favorite early Beatles album. They're just having fun &amp; they're a straight-ahead rock and roll band, before they got into all the folk stuff trying to outdo Bob Dylan. Not saying that wasn't good too. I think soon after this Paul started to become the better artist in their early period before John caught up to &amp; overtook him in their psychedelic period. Paul's singing was really good in their early work. I think they're pretty well evenly matched on this album though. Hold Me Tight is very nice.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Wow - this is a WEIRD one. Did they seriously cover Roll Over Beethoven and Money? Interesting/amusing choices for covers but they don't do a great job with them, and only a few of the originals really stand out. I'd say its weaker than Please Please Me.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Shock Horror a poor rating for a ""Beatles"" album but let's be honest shall we. The songwriting is still too much of you love me, i love you to stand out. if anything it's the covers that are the best tracks, showcasing the ear for songs which would stand them in good stead later in their career. ""Roll Over Beethoven"" and ""You Really Got A Hold"" still send a shiver down my spine.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Their second great album that year, 1963. No one else during this time period was doing anything quite like this. Some cover songs, but most of them are well-done. The originals are astonishing. No other albums of its period had this kind of energy. Don't discount the Beatles' early work simply because it was less sophisticated than the later period work. It doesn't get better than this.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">An ounce of darkness to dilute the pop happiness, and great melodies to boot.<br><br>Same people, same year - and yet the second album already is a major improvement over the first one (not that the first one was bad, not that the Beatles ever had a bad album, not that I deliberately wanna keep on apologizing, not that there aren't lots of people out there wanting to interpret this phrase as a condemnation of Please Please Me, not that all the ""not thats"" will ever help, goddammit). Just like before, there are still six covers on the finished product, but note the odd sequencing: the album opens with no fewer than five original compositions in a row, versus the two on its predecessor. By the time the first covers actually start to catch up, you'll just have to think highly of the Fab Four, or get the heck outta here.<br><br>Nevertheless, even the covers generally improve on the ways they did them before - and sometimes, improve on the originals. Thus, Paul throws in a sentimental rendition of the Music Man number 'Till There Was You' with one of Harrison's cleanest and most effective acoustic breaks ever; it's pretty hard for me to imagine that even an active hater of all things Broadway could have despised the number, so skilfully ripped out of its context and actually made believable. Nasty rumours about how the solo actually wasn't played by George abound, but given George's usual industriousness (wasn't he accepted as a permanent member because of his being able to play some complex solo that nobody else in the neighbourhood could reproduce?), I can't think of any other reason than pure nastiness for spreading the actual rumour.<br><br>Another cover, Motown this time, Smokey Robinson's 'You Really Got A Hold On Me', is transformed by John from a professional, but generic R'n'B workout into a brilliant ""epic"" with an atmosphere that's close to sarcastic and even has a bit of darkness to it. I've heard people describe it as their favourite tune off the album, and that's understandable - while the melody does not belong to the Beatles, the interpretation is all theirs. Their slowest, most ""plodding"" number so far (and thus the only track on the album that reaches the three-minute length, although barely), it almost lulls you to sleep with its nasal Lennon delivery, but then brings you up to your feet in a flash as the boys trade lines with one another in a fashion that might not be as smooth and effortlessly flowing as those coming from the Miracles, but is every bit as convincing, if not more convincing and passionate.<br><br>George is no slouch on the non-original material either, handling lead vocals on a ferocious 'Roll Over Beethoven' which, by 1963 standards, completely overshadows the source: the Beatles cling onto this Chuck Berry classic and work hard on it to suit it to their pop-rock style, and here we also have to thank Ringo whose cymbals, along with George's professional, but derivative guitar, really carry on the energy and all the butt-kicking. It's one of the tightest performances in all of the band's rock'n'roll history, and one of the very few moments when in terms of compactness and collected-ness of delivery they could actually compete with the Rolling Stones.<br><br>While we're at it, I'd like to issue a note of protest to all those people who - like there was no tomorrow - keep complaining about such supposedly 'pedestrian' numbers as 'Please Mister Postman' that the boys were baking because they admittedly 'lacked good material' or something like that. Nope. Not at all. Since George Martin's failed attempt to saddle them with the sappy 'How Do You Do It' for a single they had complete artistic freedom in the studio, and their choice of covers wasn't random or filler-dictated. 'Please Mister Postman' was a decent enough Marvelettes number - excellent, unassuming Motown fare. In the hands of John Lennon, it is a mad, frantic plea of a guy who's truly foaming at the mouth, totally devastated by the lack of letters from his girlfriend; when he bellows, 'deliver the letter, the sooner the better', I can't help but being a little concerned for the fate of the postman in question. Yes, it's theater - I don't think John himself experienced any serious problems like these until at least the 1974 ""Lost Weekend"" - but what a show, ladies and gentlemen, what a show!<br><br>But then, it's only covers, and that is all, why should we feel the way we do? Let's skim through the self-penned material instead. Let's see: With The Beatles contains at least one timeless classic, 'All My Loving', whose main musical attraction actually happens to be often overlooked in favour of the much more easily noticeable vocal hooks - a wonderful, unnaturally complex (for the Beatles at the time) flamenco-style rhythm guitar. A less inventive group would be well satisfied with the vocal hooks, sticking to boring barebones rhythm; not here, where first rate vocals truly deserve a first rate musical accompaniment. George's humble, simplistic boogie solo truly pales next to it.<br><br>Few other originals from the album can be found on best-of compilations, as the Beatles were still saving their flashiest discoveries for single A-sides, but I still count only one nasty misfire, this time out of McCartney's hands rather than Lennon's: 'Hold Me Tight' is the kind of moronic ditty they truly should have outgrown by now. With its forced, and at the same time imbecilic optimism, it just feels out of place in between the aggressive 'Beethoven' and the sardonic 'You Really Got A Hold On Me', and what with my usual indignance at the term ""McCartney Fluff"", it's hard for me not to acknowledge that without songs like 'Hold Me Tight', there'd be far fewer grounds for its existence. (Ironically, a decade later Paul would write yet another song called 'Hold Me Tight' - IMHO, much better than the first one, but, alas, that's also one of those IMHOs that ain't shared by too many people).<br><br>Everything else displays growth, growth, and growth. The once inexperienced Lennon now playfully experiments with the stop-and-start structure on 'All I've Got To Do', provides the band with a terrific vehicle for vocal harmonies on 'It Won't Be Long', and invents a wonderfully complex (and catchy - you thought I'd miss my chance?..) chord sequence for 'Not A Second Time', while George makes his composing debut with the acceptable, if not exactly genius, rocker 'Don't Bother Me', with lyrics that seem to be about lost love, but were actually written by him while lying in bed with a fever, and you know what? sounds more like about lying in bed with a fever than about lost love. Besides, it's hardly a coincidence that the most recluse and introspective member of the band would start his songwriting career with a song called 'Don't Bother Me'. Could have been his motto until the end.<br><br>Perhaps the most notable thing about With The Beatles is this relatively weird 'slackery' on Paul's part: apart from the obviously second-, if not third-rate 'Hold Me Tight', and 'All My Loving', of course, he doesn't seem to be writing a huge lot on here. Maybe this is why With The Beatles always used to strike me as a somewhat bleaker, darker, more dangerous companion to the happiness-and-sunshine world of Please Please Me. Obviously, this contrast owes a lot to the difference between the two album sleeves - shiny happy faces in early '63 vs black-and-white no-smile colouring in late '63 - but it is a fact that there's too much George and John on the record and too few Paul. (Even the obligatory Ringo solo spot, 'I Wanna Be Your Man', plays with ominous overtones - be careful with your subconscious. The song was originally written for the Rolling Stones, who recorded it with ten times the fire and aggression, but some of the spookiness managed to cling on to the Beatles' own stockings as well). And when there's too much George and John and too few Paul, be prepared for a serious pepper overdose instead of sugar.<br><br>This 'bitterness' can perhaps be best illustrated by comparing the last numbers on the two '63 albums. Both 'Twist And Shout' and 'Money' are powerful non-original Lennon screamers, but where the former is just sort of a vigorous youthful rallying battle cry, 'Money' is, of course, a piece of satire - sort of an undercover attack on the very values that, let's admit it, brought the Beatles into show business in the first place. And so it's one thing when Lennon spends his precious vocal cords on 'shake it-uh baby now', and quite a different one when he does likewise for 'now give me money, that's what I want'. And this is With The Beatles' main success - it is more than just a pop album, more than just 'shallow fluff'. It's got a bite to it, and a rather disturbing one for 1963. In fact, in terms of melody, musicality, and originality next year's Hard Day's Night might have it beat, but in terms of ""relevance"" it was actually regressing one step back - fortunately, not for long.<br><br><br>Track picks:<br>All My Loving<br>Till There Was You<br>You Really Got a Hold On Me<br>Not a Second Time</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> was the Beatles' second album from 1963.  Like their debut album <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>, there are six cover versions and eight original songs (including one written by George Harrison).  There are some signs of progress from the first album, John and Paul's songwriting has improved, and they've chosen some better songs to cover (at least in my opinion), but really I don't think there's much to choose between <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>.<br><br>The album gets off to a good start with John Lennon's ""It Won't Be Long"", an uptempo song with a ""yeah, yeah"" call-and-response chorus, and lyrics featuring some clever wordplay - ""It won't be long till I belong to you"".  ""All I've Got To Do"" is another Lennon song, which he said was inspired by Smokey Robinson &amp; The Miracles.  This is a slower, moodier song with great vocals from John and is one of my personal favourites.   Paul's ""All My Loving"" is probably the best-known song from the album due to its wonderfully catchy melody, George's country-style guitar solo, and one of John's greatest performances on rhythm guitar.   Next we have the first track written by George to appear on a Beatles album - ""Don't Bother Me"".  It's quite interesting musically and the lyrics convey a darker, more pessimistic atmosphere compared to the opening three tracks.  Sadly, George is often overlooked as a songwriter, but this song proves that even in the early days he could write material that stood up well beside most of Lennon and McCartney's efforts.  <br><br>""Little Child"" is one of the weaker tracks here - lots of energy and some great harmonica playing, but nothing special about it, while ""Till There Was You"" (a cover of a song from the musical The Music Man) is another of my least favourite moments on the album.  There's nothing wrong with the Beatles' performance and Paul sings it well, but I just don't like the song.  The next cover, ""Please Mister Postman"", returns to the more familiar territory of Motown while ""Roll Over Beethoven"" with George on lead vocals is a flawless Chuck Berry cover.  I've always really liked Paul's ""Hold Me Tight"" despite the fact that his singing seems slightly out of tune in places and the backing vocals aren't perfect either.  Still, it's an upbeat, catchy song that I enjoy listening to.  <br><br>Although ""You Really Got A Hold On Me"" is another cover, it's one of my favourite tracks on the album - due mainly to John's fantastic vocals.   ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" was given to the Rolling Stones and was one of their first hit singles.  The <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> version gives Ringo a chance to sing lead.  ""Devil In Her Heart"" is not a bad cover and features another good vocal for George but is one of the more forgettable tracks on the album.  ""Not A Second Time"" shows how John's songwriting had progressed - The Times' music critic famously praised the 'Aeolian cadences' (whatever they are!) at the end of the song.  It's not one of his more memorable melodies, but still a good song.  The album closes with one last cover version - this time a rendition of the Barrett Strong hit ""Money"", featuring another of John's great vocals.  <br><br>I love <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> but as their best work was still to come, I'm unable to give it more than 4 stars.<br><br>Rating: 4/5<br>Highlights: All I've Got to Do, All My Loving, You Really Got a Hold on Me, Money</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Eigentlich wurde bereits millionenfach alles gesagt. Muss ich noch auf den Haufen scheissen? Ich muss: meine persönlichen Favoriten auf der Scheibe sind: ""All My Loving"" und ""Till There Was You"". <br><br>Kaufempfehlung? Ohne Worte - diese Scheibe darf in keiner Sammlung fehlen.<br><br>Einige Trivialitäten:<br><br>A1 ""It Won't Be Long""<br><br>This was the first song Neil Young performed for an audience. He played it at his high school cafeteria. John Lennon's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out. The word ""yeah"" is repeated 56 times.<br><br>A2 ""All I've Got to Do""<br><br>John Lennon wrote this in 1961 in the style of Smokey Robinson and The Miracles. It was one of 3 songs (along with ""It Won't Be Long"" and ""Not A Second Time"") that was written without McCartney for album With The Beatles. John stated: ""That's me trying to do Smokey Robinson again."" This particular song was inspired by the Miracles song ""You Can Depend On Me."" This was recorded on September 11, 1963 at Abbey Road studios in London. The Beatles never performed it on stage.<br><br>A3 ""All My Loving""<br><br>This was the first time Paul McCartney wrote the words to a song before the music. The song began as a poem he conceived while he was shaving one morning thinking about his girlfriend Jane Asher, who he met when she interviewed him for the magazine Radio Times. He wrote the music that night. He originally envisioned it as a country/western song. This Beatles classic was never released as a single, but it was the first song the group played on their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance: February 9, 1964. It was a historic telecast, as over 73 million people tuned in. At the time, that was the largest audience ever for a TV show. McCartney sang lead on this. His vocal was double-tracked to bring it out in the mix. George Harrison's guitar solo was influenced by Chet Atkins, one of his idols when he was learning to play. John Lennon was always fond of the grinding rhythm guitar he contributed to the studio recording.<br><br>A4 ""Don't Bother Me""<br><br>This was George Harrison's first recorded song. It was his response to critics who claimed he was not an important member of the group because he did not write songs.<br><br>This was the first song on Side 2 of Meet The Beatles, their first album released in the US. With The Beatles was their second UK release. George wrote this when he was down with the flu in a hotel room in the Northeast of England. The Beatles chauffeur kept various tapes which the band were working on. Years later these were sold off at one of the London auction houses. This song in it's very earliest stages is available on bootleg and features George working the music and lyrics out as he goes along. George stated, ""I wrote the song as an exercise to see if I could write a song. I was sick in bed. Maybe that's why it turned out to be 'Don't Bother Me.'""<br><br>A5 ""Little Child""<br><br>A genuine fifty-fifty effort between John and Paul. They did two takes on the 11th, another sixteen on the 12th, and re-did the vocals a few weeks later. There's been some debate about who ended up singing the final version, because some people think that they're both harmonising, but other people think that John is double-tracked. John was famously self-concious about his voice, thinking it was thin and weedy. George Martin remembered: “He was a great admirer of Elvis Presley's early records, particularly the 'Heartbreak Hotel' kind of sound. He also had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice! You know, put something on it. Smother it with tomato ketchup or something. Make it different.'”<br><br>A6 ""Till There Was You""<br><br>This was written in 1957 for the Broadway musical The Music Man. It was written by songwriter Meredith Willson, who also wrote ""76 Trombones"" for the same musical as well as the seasonal favorite ""It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas."" The Beatles performed this on their first Ed Sullivan Show appearance, February 9, 1964. This was a huge event, as Beatlemania had just come to America. This was the only song they played that night that was not one of their hits - they put it in to appeal to the older audience that was tuned in. As they played, the camera zoomed in on each Beatle and superimposed their first name. When it got to Lennon, it read, ""Sorry girls, he's married."" This was also performed during the Beatles appearance on the Royal Variety Show on November 4, 1963. It was probably also appealing to the older audience and it provided a break between the up-tempo numbers, ""She Loves You"" and ""Twist and Shout.""<br><br>B2 ""Hold Me Tight""<br><br>One of the lesser-known Beatles songs, this was recorded during the Please Please Me sessions, but left off the album. The Beatles re-recorded it for With The Beatles. Paul McCartney: ""I can't remember much about that one. Certain songs were just 'work' songs, you haven't got much memory of them. That's one of them."" <br><br>B3 ""You Really Got a Hold on Me""<br><br>Miracles leader Smokey Robinson wrote this for his wife Claudette after hearing Sam Cooke's ""Bring It On Home To Me"" on the radio. Claudette was a singer in the group. She and Robinson had 2 children - Berry, named after Motown president Berry Gordy, and Tamla, named after Gordy's record label The Miracles recorded on. When Motown was growing into a dominant label in 1962, they set up a tour where many of their acts performed together around the United States. For many people, this was their first look at Motown acts like The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and Marvin Gaye. This was the biggest Motown hit at the time, so The Miracles closed the shows with it. The Beatles were the first big British band to come to America and admit they were influenced by black music. Robinson admired this, and felt they helped black artists by covering their songs. The Beatles recorded this in 1963. They performed it in their last movie, Let It Be.<br><br>B4 ""I Wanna Be Your Man""<br><br>John Lennon and Paul McCartney were working on this when they were invited to the Rolling Stones' studios. They finished it on the spot and gave it to the Stones, who used it as their second single in England. Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were amazed and soon began writing their own songs. Ringo sang lead. It was his showpiece song during their live performances from 1963-1966. Contrary to popular opinion, this was not the only song recorded by both The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. ""Money (That's What I Want)"" was recorded by both groups as well. It appears on the album With the Beatles as well as the Stones' More Hot Rocks (Big Hits and Fazed Cookies).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Fantastical. It’s 1963 and The Beatles are completely huge. Beatlemania is sweeping Britain. The fans are absolutely dying, just DYING for an album, a follow up to Please Please Me. So, the Liverpool lads headed into the studio and recorded With The Beatles, a great album. Maybe better than Please Please Me.<br><br>The Lennon/McCartney compositions are the best tunes, as one would expect. With The Beatles has some of the Beatles’ best pop. “It Won’t Be Long,” the high energy opener is typical Beatles fare – Good hooks and call and response shouts of yeah. It’s a good tune. One of my favorite Beatles tunes is on this album – “All My Loving.” This song is an absolutely fantastic slice of pop. The country/western flair on the guitar; the great lyrics; the drumming; the bass – this song is just perfect. It’s my favorite on the album. “Hold Me Tight” is a solid tune.  The chorus is just wonderful. Apparently the band didn’t like it, though. “All I’ve Got To Do” is a nice ballad. “Little Child” is a good rock and roll tune. “Not A Second Time” is not very memorable, but an alright tune. Of course, Ringo needed a song to sing. So he got one of my favorites – “I Wanna Be Your Man.” It’s an up tempo high-energy song that perfectly fits Ringo. George Harrison also got his first composition on an album here. His “Don’t Bother Me” is a darker tune, but enjoyable any ways.<br><br>With their covers, The Beatles fare slightly better than they did last time, on Please Please Me. The best cover is George’s take on “Roll Over Beethoven.” It’s rather enjoyable. The closer, “Money,” is a ferocious take on a rock n roll classic, like “Twist and Shout.” It’s a good song. The other really good cover is “Please Mister Postman.” The rest are not very good; these are superior.<br><br>With The Beatles is a huge improvement from Please Please Me. Better originals and better covers, this is a great album. A worthy addition to your collection, especially if you enjoy the Beatles pop stuff.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Another solid pop album.  Lots of good covers.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No huge hits here, but a solid album. I love hearing the Motown covers. It's great to see and hear the respect shown to that great label.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Really stupid decision from The Beatles to make six covers again. Almost half of the album is covers. Even if the covers are mostly good six covers out of 14 songs is a way too much.<br><br>A-side really offers some absolutely fantastic stuff, but also some poor moments. ""It Won't Be Long"", ""All My Loving"" which is clearly the best song in the album, ""Little Child"" and the great cover ""Please Mister Postman"" are fantastic stuff. But the rest is just OK. None of the songs in the A-side is bad, but some of them are just nothing special.<br><br>B-side has four covers and just three songs are their own material. The Beatles's version of Chuck Berry's ""Roll Over Beethoven"" is great, but next two songs are boring. ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" is really simple song as usual, but it works good. ""Devil in Her Heart"" is a cover once again. It's OK. Next song is ""Not a Second Time"" and it's The Beatles's own song and it's good. Typical Beatle track. Ending track is ""Money (That's What I Want)"" and surprise surprise it's a cover. Maybe the second best cover in the record in my opinion.<br><br>Once again so damn many covers will lower the rating. This album is in the same class as their debut. OK album.</span>"
