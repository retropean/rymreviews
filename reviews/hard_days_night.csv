review
"<span itemprop=""description"">Even after all these years, the Beatles' first film remains one of the most enjoyable mergings of rock music and celluloid.  John's subsequent complaint that it simplified each members' persona in the eyes of the public is probably true.  What sticks with me, though, is the sense of the Beatles as a quartet of anti-Establishment, us-vs.them brothers, prisoners of their unprecedented fame but with the benefit of not having to go it alone.  As much as I enjoy the absurdism of them chasing the train that they were inside a moment prior or George's wicked takedown of a self-important trend-setter, their easy banter with one another is what keeps mw watching over and over.<br>As for the accompanying LP (half of which we in the US missed out on until subsequent releases), we have:<br><br>""A Hard Day's Night"" - The fact that this track, one of their best originals of 1964, was written in a few hours around the title phrase gives an indication as to just how inspired these guys were at this point.  It’s also one of the few times John composed a straightforward love song without any hidden agendas, unless you count him choosing his girl over sleep as some kind of “see-how-lucky-you-are?” message.  Love the pre-funk keyboard solo, even if it is mixed a bit too loud, and that opening chord still stands as on of rock’s most easily identifiable (though the Kinks' on “Do It Again” sounds suspiciously similar: Ray was never one to shy away from recycling).<br><br>""I Should Have Known Better"" - When I first got into the Beatles, I liked this song a lot more than I do now.  I still think that “When I tell you that I love you” refrain is brilliance, especially the leap into falsetto on “mine”, and the 12-string results in a nice meaty guitar sound, meshing with the harmonica like an old friend.  But really, this is second-rate “Hard Day’s Night” material, which means it’s only good instead of great.  All bands should be so cursed.<br><br>""If I Fell"" - Here’s all the proof anyone should need that John and Paul brought out the best in one another: their harmonies on “If I Fell” are so intertwined, so essential to each other, that it’s impossible to conceive the song without both of them.  It’s Paul’s heartbreakingly pure countermelody, contrasted with typically cautious lyrics from John (the whole idea of falling in love is presented as a hypothetical), that makes this true to its Lennon-McCartney songwriting credit.  George and Ringo stick to the background, though I love the former’s brief fills between verses.  Really, though, Keith Moon and Jimmy Page could’ve been doing their stuff, and it still would’ve paled in comparison to the magic of 2 voices that were destined to sing together, for the benefit of music lovers then, now and forever.<br><br>""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You"" - By far the weakest track of the material written for the film, which makes John and Paul’s decision to let George sing it seem like less a gift than a punishment.  He does what he can, but the only Beatle to make any impression here is Ringo, whose drumming at least makes this a decent dance track.  I can't believe that George didn't have any compositions of his own that were better than this, but maybe that wasn't an option.<br><br>""And I Love Her"" - The first of Paul’s great ballads, applying his love for the timeless melodies of show tunes with the directness that he favored as a lyricist.  In true Beatle style, he makes things more interesting by playing with pronouns, switching from third person to first on the “A love like ours” middle eighth, and drops the double-tracked vocal for “Bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky”, adding an intimacy which no doubt thrilled thousands of teenage girls.  Ringo keeps the percussion simple, and George echoes the main melody during his gentle acoustic solo.  The combination of this and “If I Fell” made for one of the Beatles’ strongest-ever 45s: I assume that the abundance of product at the time is what kept it from charting higher.  <br><br>""Tell Me Why"" - Having decided that ""A Hard Day's Night"" would consist of all-original material, John decided to write his own version of a Motown song.  The opening chords are straight out of ""Heat Wave"", and the vocal arrangement of the verses echoes the girl group sound to a tee.  That falsetto break reminds us, as if we needed it, that being a famous rock star can be a blast.<br><br>""Can't Buy Me Love"" - This song debuted atop the Billboard charts on the same day I debuted in a delivery room at Mt. Kisco, New York.  So I suppose it’s ironic that it’s never been one of my favorites.  By far the best part is George’s fierce, double-tracked guitar solo, one of the finest in his early career.  Starting with the title phrase is an interesting choice (from George Martin, if memory serves), and Paul sings with typical gusto.  But overall, “Can’t Buy Me Love” isn’t of the same high standard set by the LP it appears on or the other 45’s The Beatles were releasing at the time.<br><br>""Any Time At All"" - The first non-soundtrack song here has always been highly regarded critically (and by many fans), but it’s never done much for me.  The only notable features are Ringo’s slam before the title phrase and one of the few times John overlaps his vocals, so that the sections of the verse run into one another.  It works better on “Julia”, which also has the benefit of not having an awful solo.<br><br>""I'll Cry Instead"" - I’ve noticed that a lot of John’s early Beatles cuts are based on hypotheticals or contradictions of some type.  In this case, his threat to become an international heartbreaker is negated because he’s too busy crying over a lost girlfriend.  Aside from giving us a glimpse of future angst with “I’ve got a chip on my shoulder that’s bigger than my feet” and letting Paul show off his bass chops briefly, John’s peerlessly nuanced vocals let us know that he realizes how ridiculous he sounds, but the boy can’t help it.<br><br>""Things We Said Today"" - For the second time (after ""All My Loving""), Paul uses the Fabs' punishing tour schedule as a songwriting topic.  Paul has no doubts about absence making the heart grow fonder: his romantic optimism is a thread that runs throughout his career, though he's thankfully taken a detour now and then.  I love the way he contrasts the easygoing verses with a much more aggressive refrain, with his almost-arrogant confidence bolstered by Ringo's pounding.  It's yet another song that any other band would release as a single.  It' awesome to hear Paul shout out the ""DAY!"" on the excellent Hollywood Bowl version.<br><br>""When I Get Home"" - The weakest song here, ""When I Get Home"" has a threadbare melody, lyrics that sound like place-holders (including the infamous ""I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home""), and 4 musicians trying and failing to make something out of nothing.  To me, John is enjoyable singing pretty much anything: this is an exception.<br><br>""You Can't Do That"" - The first instance in Beatle history where a b-side of a single is superior to its flip, not that ""You Can't Do That"" is anywhere as commercial as ""Can't Buy Me Love"". John's warning against fraternizing with other fellows is sung with such glee that he sounds like he's looking forward to being deceived. He sounds more concerned about being laughed at than he does about being cuckolded, and his guitar solo snarls and sputters in sympathy with his dilemma.  One of the least known of their classic rockers.<br><br>""I'll Be Back"" - Although the songwriting of the pre-“Rubber Soul” Beatles is usually dismissed as lightweight, a closer listen reveals that John, in particular, is touching upon themes that resonate throughout his career.  The girl he’s singing to is tired of the games he plays, the roadblocks he puts up: instead of chasing him when he runs away, she lets him go.  Now he finds himself trying to get back in her good graces, and the song ends without resolution.  It’s not exactly Dylan, but there’s a lot more to it than initially meets the ear.  <br><br><br>As you can see, this is a John-heavy LP, and for the most part he comes through with flying colors.  Paul contributes a pair of his greatest songs and one of his most popular: more importantly, the partnership proves that they can carry the songwriting burden all by themselves, even though they wouldn't again for another 3 albums (with help from George).  If you're going to own one pre-""Help!"" collection, this is the one to get.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Next time on ChrisPC reviews nostalgia city starring the boys from Liverpool the Beatles. <br><br>Whats to say this is where they get really kicking as they would say, as a huge fan of early Beatles singles this one is a real keeper. This has them in there early style but there not jacking other people's styles as much. The Beatles were never innovative, here they even run through the motions the entire album, but it is a tour de force on how exactly to execute to perfection, it is slick, beautiful, heartpounding symposium of awesomeness as I would tell Black Alex(aka Birdturd93)<br><br>Whats to say, I heard 10 of these 13 tracks at other times and at worst the tracks would be an upper 3.5 stars, there are about 5 increddible songs on here as well, A Hard Day's Night, I Should have known better, Cant buy me love chief among them. Whats to say in summary, I guess this is just really good Beatles music. nothing that the hipster and metalheads would dig but this was exactly how to make a pop/rock LP in the 60's. Maybe my fave album from the Lads though not there best one that would be Revolver, Sgt Peppers, or the White Album.<br><br>Love you Beatles!!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Spanish rating Beatles is like English rating LODVG. Just Impossible.<br><br>Siento dar una nota normalita al disco. Tengo la impresión de que en los 60 en general y entre los Beatles en particular, se llevaba la moda de hacer discos con dos o tres canciones tremendamente buenas y el resto de los LP de relleno.<br><br>Que nadie me compare A hard days night, una obra maestra de 6 puntos con Things we said today, When i get home, If i fell, You can´t do that, Ill be back o tell me why, canciones entre normal y bien (2,5 a 3 estrellas). ¿O acaso estas canciones son Obras Maestras de 5 estrellas. <br><br>Si bien creo que Los Beatles ha sido el mayor grupo de la historia, con más influencia que ninguno, también pienso que sus LP en general están sobrevalorados. No todo lo que hicieron fue fabuloso. <br><br>Y aunque cuando tocan la tecla no hay quien les iguale, cuando se tiran un pedo también huelen. <br><br>A1 A Hard Day's Night   5+<br>A2 I Should Have Known Better   4,5.

Prefiero Help.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's funny, but I'm probably the only person in RYM who likes ""Please Please Me"" and ""With The Beatles"" better than this.<br><br>Yes, this is a more consistent record. However, it fails in giving us spectacular moments after the ending of the title track (an awesome Rock &amp; Roll classic).<br><br>Every songs are fine in a way (there aren't cheesy moments in this record like there were in the first two), but I guess that the fact this is a more balanced album makes it less interesting to me.<br><br>But hey, it's The Beatles and still is a fundamental and funny listening.<br><br>Also, the artwork's absolutely great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Well, there's happy, and then there's REALLY happy, and then there's <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> happy. This album is the audio equivalent of that one night we've all spent hopped up on Pixie Stix. Yes, it was fun dumping thirteen of the damn things down your throat over the course of a half hour, and the subsequent head rush it gave you was even more fun, but then comes the next morning. You're exhausted because those awful Pixie Stix kept you from sleeping, your blood sugar levels have spiked so high that you'll need to go the rest of the week without consuming anything sweet to bring them back down to a healthy level, your stomach hurts, your head hurts, and you're vaguely embarrassed with yourself. Wasn't enough to reach for those Flaming Lips or New Pornographers records of yours, was it? No, you had to go with the sine qua whatever of happy albums: A Hard Day's Night.<br><br>I mean, it's fun and all, but my jaded post-ironic modern sensibilities (or something like that) leave me expecting the album to just all of the sudden snap and go on a multi-state killing spree. Even the minor-key ballad ""Things We Said Today's"" lyrics are of the ""Hey, you love me! I'm so happy you love me! Everything is going perfectly between us, and that's the way life will always be!"" variety that would probably get you a restraining order if you tried something similar in real life. And while it's fun in small doses, taken as one album, it just gets to you. And it's also kind of dated. <br><br>Besides, I can't help but feel that these early Beatles albums would have been fantastic pop records if they had been allowed to release one a year instead of being coerced into two by their fucking record companies. Both this album and their other '64 release, Beatles for Sale, contain a lot of throwaways. I mean, seriously, about half this album can best be described as ""pleasant throwaway."" ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You,"" ""Tell Me Why,"" ""Any Time at All,"" ""I'll Cry Instead,"" <em class=""rymfmt"">and</em> ""Things We Said Today,"" all on the same album? I mean, I like all of these songs, but they're Pixie Stix. And the other point I was gonna make about Pixie Stix before I got sidetracked was that there are <em class=""rymfmt"">far</em> better sugarcoated indulgences out there than Pixie Stix. I could do without them, and I could REALLY do without ""When I Get Home,"" which has to be one of the band's single most irritating songs. Eesh. Take the best half of this, combine them with the best half of For Sale (which had even MORE filler, and that filler was annoying instead of pleasant), and you'd have something very good. But I'm not even sure how often I'd listen to <em class=""rymfmt"">that</em>, because I every time I hear early Beatles I can't help but feel that <a title=""[Album205]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/rubber-soul-3/"" class=""album"">Rubber Soul</a> was just a couple years around the corner.<br><br>But you know, there are still plenty of worthwhile songs here, even though the only one I'm going to say can stand up to the best of the band's work is ""I'll Be Back,"" whose cynical, mature lyrics and chiming acoustic guitars make it sound like Rubber Soul actually came two years early. And hey, maybe ""If I Fell"" fits under this too, because those harmonies are really pretty and all of the melodic twists are very nice. In truth, though, I'm sort of burned out on the big hits - ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""And I Love Her,"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" are all quality stuff, but you can only hear 'em on the radio so many times before enough becomes enough. They've kind of fallen into the same void as ""Yesterday"" has for me, but I still like them all a lot more than that one, at least. The resident anomaly is ""You Can't Do That,"" which honestly is a great song, with a riff that probably was the hardest anyone ever knew rock got in 1964. <br><br>So yeah, it's... like, it's early Beatles, you know? So it's fun for a spell, and it's well-written and well-sung and all that, but don't be surprised if the happy levels get to you. And I may think <a title=""[Album313905]"" href=""/release/album/the-new-pornographers/twin-cinema/"" class=""album"">Twin Cinema</a> was one of the greatest albums of last decade, but even I have my limits with happy music, and this is just this side of J-Pop.<br><br>Track picks: ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""And I Love Her,"" ""I'll Be Back""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">That one silly pop masterpiece to top all other silly pop masterpieces, you know.<br><br>Another major breakthrough for the band - a record consisting of nothing but Lennon-McCartney originals. They weren't exactly the first to do this, but arguably they were the first who could not only boast a collection of original songs that large, but also prove that all of them were, in fact, originals, rather than stolen R'n'B compositions with re-written lyrics (a practice that so often marred the work of their competitors). Not that the boys ever made a fuss of it themselves, or had their promoters put a heavy emphasis on this aspect. They didn't need it.<br><br>There is a bit of confusion about this record; although it's titled after the band's first movie, only the first half of it really contains the true soundtrack to A Hard Day's Night, with the second side being completely unrelated (although a short 'photoreel' set to 'I Cry Instead' used to open some VHS editions of the movie; I'm guessing it was some sort of early promotional thing). But that's the British edition; the American edition was the true soundtrack, leaving half of these songs behind and replacing them with instrumental versions of the remaining tracks that made or did not make it onto the screen. The American version is, of course, practically unavailable today, but if you ever happen to come upon a used LP in a dustbin, don't hesitate to pick it up if only for the superb instrumental performance of 'This Boy' (subtitled 'Ringo's Theme') - a great mood piece if there ever was one, perfectly accentuating a bored Ringo strolling through the riverbank in the movie (remember that?).<br><br>But we're not really dealing with the movie here, mind you. The movie was blistering, smart, and multi-layered, showing the good sides of the band and life on the road as well as hinting at the bad ones. The album, on the other hand, is a thoroughly calculated affair: positive throughout, all gloss and shine and happiness and sentimentalism, with only a few bleaker spots on the second side for compensation. That weird ominous atmosphere of With The Beatles is all but gone. Am I sorry? Am I miserable? I ain't. The record leaves no space for misery. These songs are just so goddamn great that any attempts at ""deepening"" them with extra meaning and extra feeling would only ruin their brilliant simplicity.<br><br>There's just so many of these little wonderful things to be said about this stuff I don't know where to begin. Well - how about from the very beginning? This is the third time in a row that the Beatles jump right into action, grabbing the listener and commanding his attention from the very first second. After the ""one two three FOUR!"" of Please Please Me and then the 'it won't be long YEAH yeah YEAH yeah!' of With The Beatles comes the famous opening power chord of 'A Hard Day's Night', and then, once again, the song is being launched without any frickin' intro. Running ahead - the Beatles wouldn't allow ""intros"" until Rubber Soul, and even then they'd be short and up to the point.<br><br>Again, it's fun to see them wiggle their way out of their ""instrumental deficiency"" - about half of these songs don't have instrumental breaks at all, content to lure the listener with mighty vocal hooks, and when they do have instrumental breaks, they prefer to make them minimalistic and meaningful rather than have George play a barrage of energetic, but boring R'n'B chords. On the title track he simply mimics John's vocal melody, with great results; same thing, with greater results, on 'I Should Have Known Better'. Same thing, with even greater results, on 'And I Love Her'! Certainly such an approach can't be called ""inventive"", but what's so basically wrong about instrumentally mimicking a cool vocal melody? Compare it with George's two solos on the second side ('Anytime At All' and 'You Can't Do That'), where he doesn't do this - don't the solos on side A sound so much better? 'Anytime At All', in fact, is almost dragged down by that solo.<br><br>It's interesting to see them further experimenting with song structure, like on 'If I Fell', for instance, a ballad where you can hardly define the borders between verse, chorus, and middle-eight, a song that has the feel of being played on one breath from beginning to end. Or 'I'll Be Back', where you can't actually tell what is the verse and what is the chorus, or just how many different bridges there are. This isn't ""massive"" experimentation by all means, but it's stuff like that that saves the album from ever becoming monotonous.<br><br>It's interesting to see just how even the songs that are obvious ""filler"" are still unforgettable. The George-given 'I'm Happy Just To Dance With You' was most probably slapped together in a few minutes for that exact purpose, to give George something to sing, yet it sure ain't no 'Hold Me Tight'-like nonsense: with its chuggin' rhythm guitar, invigorating whoah-whoahs, and George's seriously nerdy vocal delivery (so nerdy, in fact, that it almost gives the lyrics extra convincing force - I could imagine a guy like that coming up to his passion and stating 'I've discovered I'm in love with you... ya know?'), it's actually a scream! So is 'Tell Me Why', which gets by due to its insane tempo, a chorus that threatens to fall apart yet admirably holds on, and, of course, the classic idea of singing 'is there anything I can do-o-o?' in an unexpected falsetto as opposed to the roughness and gruffness of the main delivery.<br><br>Only one song doesn't seem to be rising up to the standard, and that is 'When I Get Home'. Actually, there's so much Lennon on this record that it's surprising he only really blows it once, not being nearly as ""accomplished"" a songwriter as Paul (in the early years at least), but when he does blow it, he blows it hard. 'When I Get Home' is pretty lame, and not just because its melody is less memorable (it is), but also because through all of its two minutes John is straining so hard to get his message across to us that when this message actually does get across, the immediate psychologic reaction is: ""Now wait a minute... he simply wants to get home as quickly as possible?"" After the angry brokenheartedness of 'I'll Cry Instead' and the anthemic posturing of 'Anytime At All', this goofy inadequacy is really a major disappointment. Fortunately, he quickly redeems himself with the threats and the pleading on 'You Can't Do That', but the flaw is already there.<br><br>Paul does leave a serious mark on the album as well - with nothing less than three classics: 'And I Love Her', which even today, for me, is one of his most ""easily tolerable"" saccharine ballads (mainly because of the stern and solemn acoustic riff carrying the song), 'Can't Buy Me Love', which still remains one of the best rock'n'roll songs from these guys (and contains the only 'non-mimicking' guitar lead on this record that's actually quite worthy - get it on George!), and the mysterious 'Things We Said Today', a song whose lyrical optimism is in strange disagreement with its musical pessimism. Again, no matter how many live versions of that last song I have heard, whether it be from the Beatles or from solo McCartney, none of them ever matched the smoothness and preciseness of the studio original.<br><br>Still, if hard pressed, I'd give first prize to John's 'I Should Have Known Better'. Words cannot describe the gorgeousness of that middle eight, can they? Where does it come from? And it's not just the trick of having each line end with a differently intoned exclamation ('oh-1', 'oh-2', and, most importantly, the 'uh-huh-huh!' falsetto with its orgasmic effect), it's the way the lines themselves are structured - so disconnected and unpredictable upon first sight, and then so logically ""sewn"" together with the '...you're gonna say you love me too...' conclusion. Likewise, that harmonica melody easily stands out as the most uplifting moment to come out of the year 1964.<br><br>A Hard Day's Night is certainly the culmination of the ""early"" Beatles - still unburdened by 'heavyweight' musical matters and at the same time reaching absolute perfection in the 'lightweight' spheres. But the funny thing is, at least, according to my impressions, that it actually took them to achieve this kind of perfection in order for the entire proceedings to start looking a little ""fake"". In a way, the album is just too damn perfect. In a way, Please Please Me comes across as sort of more natural-sounding, if you get my drift. It's pretty obvious that the Beatles were getting too big for this kind of britches, putting way too much effort into songs that, in all honesty, didn't really deserve it (hence the occasionally annoying disparity between melody and lyrics). And it's not like I'm turning my nose at simple pop songs or anything - it's just that there's always scope, and there's always a pool of talent, and then they meet like the proverbial Aristotelian form and substance, and in this here case there's too much substance for too little form. Which, provided, is still way better than the opposite. But which also means there'd be a good direction for improvement.<br><br><br>Track picks:<br>A Hard Day's Night<br>I Should Have Known Better<br>And I Love Her<br>Can't Buy Me Love<br>Things We Said Today<br>I'll Be Back</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">""All right, bobo! What're we reviewing tonight?, I asked Beauregard, the rockin' housecat. ""BEATLES"", replied the cat with much emphasis. ""I'm there"", I said....""What's next in the lineup?"" Bobo walked to the CD shelf and retrieved the next unreviewed Beatles CD in our collection. ""Hey, It's <em class=""rymfmt"">A hard Day's Night</em>, the band's third album released back in those heady days of the summer of '64"". ""What do you mean?"", I asked. The cat continued...""Man ya had to have been there. The band had broke bad in the USA earlier in the year. Beatlemania was ravaging the land and no quarter was given.

""It must be that John Lennon influence on the songwriting. From the opening chord of the title track, ""A Hard Day's Night"" to the closing, ""I'll Be Back"". Jus' oozing rock-n-roll.

In addition to the title track, we have: Lennon's ""I Should Have Known Better""; the McCartney ballad' ""And I Love Her"", followed by his rocker ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (Who says Mac can't rock?). Lennon counters with the punkish ""Any Time At all"" and the downbeat countryish ""I'll Cry Instead"". Not to be taken lightly, Paul replies with one of my fav McCartney tracks, ""Things We Said Today"". Damn, it don't get better then that. Ringo's rock beat moves the song along nicely. The album ends with three Lennon rockers, including ""When I Get Home"" and the exquisite in your face ""You Can't Do That"". First rate stuff here, folks.

The Beatles had been parted for six years. But I knew: I need to have it. So I bought the record from my pocket money and it took my breath away.<br>Such a bunch of wonderful songs that still shook my mind. 12 years after their release!<br>Beginning with the powerful title track.<br>Of course the mentioned <em class=""rymfmt"">""I Should Have Known Better""</em> with that smart harmonica.<br><em class=""rymfmt"">""If I Fell""</em> the little sad pop piece followed by a blitheful <em class=""rymfmt"">""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You""</em>.<br><em class=""rymfmt"">""And I Love Her""</em> - one of the most beautiful declarations of love arranged on an elegant rumba rhythm. While I was still in mind with my love <em class=""rymfmt"">""Tell Me Why""</em> whooshed over.<br><em class=""rymfmt"">""Can't Buy Me Love""</em> closes the first side effectively.<br>Switched - and - <strong class=""rymfmt"">BANG!!!</strong><br><em class=""rymfmt"">""Any Time at All""</em> exploded with a doubled beat by Ringo and the most powerful voice by John. What was to come next?<br>Yep. Country pop from 1964 in <em class=""rymfmt"">""I'll Cry Instead""</em>. Minor pop in <em class=""rymfmt"">""Things We Said Today""</em>, a hard beat in <em class=""rymfmt"">""When I Get Home""</em>, the shuffle <em class=""rymfmt"">""You Can't Do That""</em> and a fantastic end with <em class=""rymfmt"">""I'll Be Back""</em>.<br><br>After 30 minutes I knew nothing would be as it was before. I've heard so many facettes of poplife and detected many of my teenage heroes as laughing stocks. If I would have had a clue what else there is in pop and rock musik I would have fell insane.<br>Today I'm aware. And some people say I'm crazy. Well - it must be so.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">My parents weren't really into music, and I spent a lot of my childhood just listening to the ""70's-80's-NOW"" stations that they had on in the car. Occasionally though, my dad would put in his Beatles cassette, this one, and we'd rock out to it. A while passed where I hadn't heard it for a while, then my pops bought it on CD, so naturally I made a copy for myself. This is my favorite Beatles release because I grew up with it and it has <em class=""rymfmt"">dem vibes</em>. What <em class=""rymfmt"">vibes</em>? Those 60's <em class=""rymfmt"">vibes</em> that this album most surely has. Tis a good one to pop in the system every now sing along.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The archetypal pure pop LP. Probably has to do with Paul and John hogging all of the songs for themselves; there's nary a trace of George's ambivalent neurosis or Indian droning, and Ringo uses up 0% of the vocal performances. And let me tell you, an entire album of Len-Mac compositions is a <strong class=""rymfmt"">fearsome</strong> thing to behold.<br><br>Or it would be if these songs weren't flagrantly so desperate to be liked. Even when a song flirts with a minor key (""I'll Be Back"", ""Things We Said Today"", ""And I Love Her"", ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"") or has an ultimately negative or censorious message (""You Can't Do That""), there's invariably a persistent undercurrent of optimism.<br><br>So instead of feeling I have a privileged view of the output of songwriting supermen, I feel I'm eavesdropping on some nervous young lads giving it their all to write song after song. That's endearing at first, but then it becomes a bit suspicious: why am I getting this impression that something's held back when I know, and they know, that this material is sound and the communication sincere?<br><br>It's the bally sameness of it all (monotony would be too harsh a word). There's no ground breaking nor a major development in talent, and a little wordplay and tricky harmony aren't enough to rectify that. Ten of the 13 songs are written solely by John, whose melodic palette is the most limited (it really is: look at how many of his songs lean on bluesy pentatonicism) out of he, Paul, and George. Any one of John's songs is delicious in isolation, thank you very much — I just get a mite fatigued by so many put together in one mass. ""Things We Said Today"", the only real McCartney solo joint, is a welcome change. ""And I Love Her"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"", although John-influenced, are also pleasant breaths of fresh air in the midst of Lennon's hyperproductivity. (Free association: ""And I Love Her""'s intro reminds me a lot of ""Sun King"".) ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Things We Said Today"" in particular are two of the best pop songs of 1964.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The album is very easy to get, and the songs flow nicely into one another. It's pretty easy listening, with some heartfelt lyrics, but the lyrical content is not exactly revolutionary.<br><br>Some highlights:<br><br>A Hard Day's Night - It may be a bad pun, but its still a good love song with a simple working class overtone.<br><br>And I Love Her - This is by far my favorite song on the album because the harmonies are the most beautiful on the album. The chords, the vocal harmonies, and the little arpeggios that pop up every now and then fit perfectly together. Just lay out under the stars with your significant other and listen to this song, and you'll see what I'm talking about.<br><br>Can't Buy Me Love - This is basically, in my opinion, the Beatles boiled down to the most basic. It's a heartfelt number that shows the Beatles at their most idealistic.<br><br>I realize I used words like ""simple"", ""genuine"", and ""heartfelt"" a lot, but that's pretty much what this album is: simple, genuine, and heartfelt.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first two UK Beatles albums featured eight original compositions and six cover songs. With what is ostensibly the soundtrack to their blockbuster 1964 film <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> (only Side One contains tracks included in the film), John Lennon and Paul McCartney forcefully revised this formula. All thirteen tracks on the album are written by them (with Lennon being the primary songwriter on approximately ten of these songs). This change results in The Beatles' first long-playing masterpiece. Sure, the lyrics retain the preoccupation with heterosexual, teenage love found on their first two albums and, musically, the songs lack the ostensible substance found on their later recordings. But unlike their first two albums, the charming if rough <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> and the more slick <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em>, this album is relatively filler-free. Even the three weakest cuts on the record, ""I'll Cry Instead,"" ""I'm Happy Just to Dance with You"" (the lone track on the album sung by George Harrison), and the ballad ""And I Love Her,"" have plenty of hummable character. Musically, The Beatles' arrangements are slightly unusual here, at least given the overall scope of their oeuvre. For one thing, most of the tracks feature John Lennon on acoustic guitar and George Harrison on an electric twelve-stringer, an arrangement that wouldn't last all that long. Then there are the songs! The eponymous opener is one of The Beatles' best. The suspended G-chord that opens the song is probably the most memorable single chord played on any Beatles record, and the sped-up piano solo, played by producer George Martin, is similarly substantial. ""I Should Have Known Better"" is nearly as infectious. Side One ends with ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" Paul McCartney's most outstanding contribution to the album, and an interesting retort to their cover of ""Money"" on the previous LP. Side Two, might be even better. Though it lacks the big hit of the first side, the rockers drive and the ballads stick to you. ""Any Time at All,"" ""You Can't Do That,"" and one of the most underrated tracks in The Beatles' discography, the rockin' ""When I Get Home,"" perfectly complement the thoughtful ballads on the side (""Thing We Said Today"" and the haunting ""I'll Be Back""). <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> moves briskly, at 31 minutes in length, never appearing dull. By breaking the formula of their earlier records and containing not one piece of filler, it is the best of their early albums. They would not craft a long-player this well until the following year's <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em>.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Easily the best Beatles album until Revolver.

There's only 5 albums by them I like and those are ""Magical Mystery Tour"" , ""White Album"", ""Rubber Soul"", ""Sgt. Peppers"", and ""Revolver"". I don't really like any of their early stuff since I don't care much for cover songs and I kinda feel they can't play instruments during their 1962-1964 period as I don't start liking any of their work until ""Rubber Soul"" and the streak continues until ""Abbey Road"" in which the streak stops as I don't like Abbey road or Let it be. There's nothing of interest on here to keep me interested. Now I did sit through the whole thing but in this albums case (and their earlier efforts) is really unfortunate. Now if you like or hate this album and as well if you like their earlier stuff as well, that'd fine because it's your own opinion and not mine. But this particular album review is my opinion. It's not the worst album of all time but it ain't exactly high ranking for my taste.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">After the release of the simple yet energetic <strong class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album17]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/please-please-me-64/"" class=""album"">Please Please Me</a></strong> and <strong class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album18]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/with-the-beatles-2/"" class=""album"">With The Beatles</a></strong> the previous year, The Beatles had played out the charming ""four young lads playing rock and roll"" niche. In the midst of Beatlemania, it was time for them to start moving forward as artists or else bore the general public into apathy. With <strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</strong> being the soundtrack to a film made with the explicit purpose of capitalizing on their phenomenal rise to fame it seems like a recipe for mediocrity... unless you're The Beatles.<br><br>Songs like ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"", and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" all show the typical Merseybeat sound and exuberant personality that they had become known for while also being slightly more well-crafted. ""And I Love Her"" is the first real honest-to-God ballad the Beatles have produced at this point in their career and was also their most interesting arrangement. A lot of the tracks on the latter half of the album fail to live up to the quality of Side A, but hold their own as they are all original compositions and feel more genuine than a cover song.<br><br>Not a huge leap from their roots, <strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</strong> does a damn good job at keeping their then signature sound fresh while simultaneously advancing the creative narrative a bit.

"<span itemprop=""description"">Catchy pop geared towards a young audience. I'm in my mid 30s, so I'm the wrong age for this type of music. And I Love Her is sung with feeling by McCartney, yet most of the other stuff here is overly commercial and strangely impersonal.<br>Best songs:<br>A Hard Day's Night<br>If I Fell<br>And I Love Her<br>Can't Buy Me Love<br>Lesser known highlight: Things We Said Today</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first masterpiece</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Their first album of all-originals, A Hard Day's Night is an unshowy landmark for the group. The first half has all the classics - the title song and its unaccounted-for chord still ring with indefinable magic and Can't Buy Me Love is brimmed with naff, head-bopping grooviness. The second half is chockablock with consistent tunage - few novelties except for the murky moodplay of Things We Said Today. Fairly one-note over 30 minutes, A Hard Days Night still does the business with a monochromed magisterialness.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">подпеваю всем песням, и, как оказалось, большинство откуда-то помню почти наизусть. <br>какие же они всё-таки милые щенки тут, банда droogs прямо - так и хочется каждому потрепать за ухом.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is a major step up from the Beatles' previous two albums. It's 100% originals (no covers to be found here!), and the songs themselves are of exceedingly better quality than those on the first two. It's still all pop, but John Lennon and Paul McCartney deliver some of the finest two-minute pop songs ever written.<br><br>From the very first second, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> hooks the listener in. That guitar chord (actually two guitars and a piano) hits you like a slap in the face, demanding your attention. This chord leads into some catchy Beatle goodness. This continues song after song after song. Even the ballads are good. I can't say that about most albums. The deeper cuts are surprisingly good, too. ""Any Time at All"" and ""Tell Me Why"" especially deserve some more attention. A solid album, and possibly the first great rock album. This <em class=""rymfmt"">is</em> Pop Songwriting 101.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Perhaps perfect for its time, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, like much of popular music from the early sixties, does not hold up well today. Sure the melodies are catchy but look under the surface and one finds simplistic hooks and nothing overly inventive that expands the musical scene of the time. Many would argue, but I stand firm that <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is just really popular music of the time that is more catchy than the rest but in the same spirit. This will change as the Beatles transition with the turbulent sixties but this album sees uninspired lyrics set to repetitive, simplistic melodies.<br><br>You have the Beatles classics here, ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" if those are your thing. After those, expect an album saturated with songs revolving primarily about love, love lost, and girls. Even the instrumentation is stripped down and overly basic. George Harrison, who will later become the most underrated member, sounds like a supporting guitarist for Lennon and McCartney and not an integral piece of the group. One of my least favorite Beatles records.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In ways, A Hard Day's Night feels like the Sgt. Pepper of The Beatles's early period. There's not really a hard and fast comparison, like going song by song, but it's more a feeling evoked by the first eight tracks on this album. Sgt. Pepper is a ride through a rainbow of heavy-hitting songs, rarely stopping to let one think. The first eight track of A Hard Day's Night operates relatively on this same wavelength. There's not much musically similar between the two album, but the <em class=""rymfmt"">feel</em> is there.<br><br>The eponymous opening track is my favorite from the album. From the mysterious opening chord, it jumps straight into the chorus. The best moment, for me, is when McCartney replaces Lennon on lead vocals, singing a second chorus/bridge. The contrasting calmness of McCarney's delivery perfectly balances the roughness of Lennon's delivery.<br><br>""I Should Have Known Better"" rests on its strong melody. The arrangement is almost similar to the opening track, but with a harmonica,  so the slower song manages to stay high-energy. Of similar high-energy is ""I'm Happy Just to Dance with You"", though Harrison's underwhelming delivery somewhat does it a disservice. It's short, and arguably the weakest song on Side A, but that's due to the strength of everything around it more so than any fault in the song itself. <br><br>""And I Love Her"" and ""If I Fell"" are both excellent ballads, featuring strong melodies. The former's strength is entirely in McCartney's vocal performance, while the latter relies on the group to pitch in and create something of a Beatles interpretation of the early Beach Boys-style harmonies. On the other end of the spectrum are ""Tell Me Why"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", and ""Any Time at All"". The bread songs in that sandwich both have booming (for the 60s) choruses and fly along at a near-reckless tempo while threatening to fall apart. Of the two, I prefer ""Tell Me Why"", mostly because I prefer the catchiness of the drawn-out ""why, eye, eye, eye you're crying"" to the call-and-response ""Any Time at All"" chorus. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" runs a little slower than the other two, and is notably the first Beatles song without any vocal harmonies, but McCartney manages to carry the whole thing along on his own, but it's arguably the accompaniment that elevates it to one of the album's best. That sudden stop aftar McCartney yells ""I don't care too..."" before slamming back into the chorus is perfect.<br><br>Finally, Side B of the album (recognizing ""Any Time at All""  technically opens it) is notably weaker than the first half. That's not to say it's bad by any means. ""I'll Cry Instead"" and ""Things We Said Today"" have a noticeably different tone from everything that precedes them. The former feels something like a throwaway track, running less than two minutes but having some interesting melodies in that time. The latter is oddly mature, both in structure and melody, while featuring a nice tonal counterpoint to the rest of the album's excitement. ""When I Get Home"" is a mess of a song, which feels somewhat thrown together rather than actually structured, and easily has the worst chorus on the album (""Whoah-whoah-aaaaa""). ""You Can't Do That"" is an improvement, but isn't particularly memorable.<br><br>""I'll Be Back"" actually ends the album on a high note, as kind of an ""If I Fell"" part 2 type of song, with a more refined chorus, actually reaching the quality of the album's first half.<br><br>I've actually only notice, after also listening to Beatles For Sale, that A Hard Day's Night actually marks something of a tradition for The Beatles.  Most of the songs on the album's A-Side would be right at home on the band's earlier records (though they would surely be the highlight of that album). The B-Side, however, is far more tonally consistent with the following albums, Beatles for Sale and Hellp!. ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Things We Said,"" in particular remind me of songs like ""Tell Me What You See"" from Help! or ""What You're Doing"" from Beatles for Sale.<br><br>Still, A Hard Day's Night would have been the apex of The Beatles's careers had they suddenly disbanded after releasing Help!. It's toe-tappingly fun all around, and absolutely worth multiple listens.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The more I listen to this, the more I realize how nonessential this whole era was for the band. Very few of the songs feel impactful or even memorable, and this is only emphasized by a botched mix that makes tracks feel like you've entered midway. The lyrics get stale after about three or so tracks once you realize that literally every track on here is just girlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirlsgirls. The bland riffs and production don't exactly brighten this up, neither.<br><br>Overall, this album has neither the charm, songwriting, or emotion that <a title=""[Album205]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/rubber-soul-3/"" class=""album"">Rubber Soul</a> would display only a year later. Out of principle, I've just begun to disregard anything that came before than, which isn't unreasonable. It's just so disheartening to relisten to a beloved album from my childhood and realize the true mediocrity of something that I once treasured.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Hey, no covers! And though it's a bit front loaded, all the songs (most of which are written by John- compare that to later albums like ""Sgt. Pepper"" where he's relatively underrepresented) are good for the most part. Definitely the best of the pre-""Help"" Beatles albums. And though John looms large here, my favorite cut is actually Paul's bossa nova flavored ""And I Love Her"", which is arguably one of his best songs ever. Other highlights include ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Things I Said Today"", ""I'll Be Back"", ""If I Fell"" and the title track.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles are hitting their stride here. It's not because the album and the movie were a great success. They were. It's because not only were the singles successful but the non-single tracks are extremely quality songs. <br><br>The experiment starts here. They whip out a 12-string guitar. They fiddle with some interesting tempos and chord structures. It feels like a huge growth happened between 'With the Beatles' and 'A Hard Day's Night'. The Beatles cut their teeth in Hamburg as far as tightening their sound. I really feel that the Beatles cut their teeth in the studio here as far as writing songs.<br><br><br>Pros: 'A Hard Day's Night', 'I Should Have Known Better', 'And I Love Her', 'Can't Buy Me Love', 'Things We Said Today', 'I'll Be Back'<br><br>Cons: 'I'll Cry Instead' is the weakest track on here but it's not bad at all.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like all the early Beatles records, this album has a lot of ups and downs but it also was the first Beatles album to feature all originals.

This should be easier and harder than the first two. I'm infinitely more familiar with this album from memory than their first two, so there's less overall research/checking I'll need to do, but the leaps in quality over the entirety of this one means I'll be spending a bit more time analyzing. Strap in.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</strong><br><br>Piano playing G, bass playing D, guitar playing F. To my ears, anyway, that's the opening chord (though there's been a hundred other attempts, even going so far as to use Fourier analysis to get a definitive answer, so I'm probably wrong). Prior to this, when people were analyzing chords in music, they were talking about classical music. Y'know, that opening chord in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, or the Cmaj triad on top of the F#maj triad in Stravinsky's Petrushka. But in <em class=""rymfmt"">pop music</em>? Bah, no. Nope. I'll admit the meat and potatoes of the track aren't super, super amazing, but it's full of stuff they hadn't done before. Paul gets his very own middle eight (to my knowledge, there's no prior Beatles track that has two distinct lead vocals), which he only got on account of John not being able to hit those high notes on the word ""tight"" without going into falsetto. I also love the arpeggio ending, which jumps over the song's main key (G) back into D to bring the opening theme back in a sort of cycle. I don't think that'd been done before either.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I Should Have Known Better</strong><br><br>Eh... it's not a bad song at all, mind you, but it's slight and a bit stupid. I've never really liked John on harmonica, the lyrics are ridiculous, and the verse/chorus setup is lazy. That being said, the middle eight is better than the whole rest of the song, featuring some seriously busy chord changes and a flawless falsetto segue. The only other thing worth mentioning is that Harrison's decision to end his solo on a perfect fourth E rather than any chord in G (the song's actual key) is another example of their sneaky use of bitonality. On a throwaway cute folksy track, no less.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">If I Fell</strong><br><br>And now we're on hallowed ground. The introductory chord sequences are absurdly unconventional, jumping all over the damn place, never revealing what key it's actually in until the verse proper starts up. Lennon's low harmony is one of the most brilliantly subtle performances on any early Beatles record, and the dual harmony lead vocal is so gorgeous and perfect it's stupid. Also has another brilliant but subtle trick in the part that goes ""If I gave my heart <strong class=""rymfmt"">to you</strong>"", ""From the very start <strong class=""rymfmt"">that you</strong>"", etc. You'll notice that on ""to""/""that"", John and Paul's harmonies are both descending, but on ""you"" Paul suddenly jumps up three semitones while John doesn't, making a minor sixth show up out of nowhere. Brian Wilson was using a similar technique around the same time (see my review for <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/the_beach_boys/surfin_usa/"" target=""_blank"">this album</a> for a more thorough explanation). Also, the chord to transition into the middle eight is a big ol' D9, and the harmonies in the middle eight, particularly the ""would be sad if our new love"" section, are ridiculously complex, rarely mirroring the same interval between them. It's a doozy of a track. Also, dig Starr with the rim clicks on the snare (rather than hitting the snare's head) giving things an even breezier feel. Neat trick.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I'm Happy Just To Dance With You</strong><br><br>Not super familiar with this one. Be right back.<br><br>...oh. Well, ok, this one's pretty minor. There are a couple of neat tricks (primarily the really strange B7aug on ""cause I'm happy just to <strong class=""rymfmt"">dance</strong> with you""), but it's not a great track, and the random ass giant drum being played during the verses isn't much more than a distraction. Written specifically by John for George to sing, which (in 64 anyway) didn't say much about the track. Moving right along.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">And I Love Her</strong><br><br>Ah yes, And I Love Her. Quite a departure. First of all, Ringo's playing bongos and claves. No drums. Just percussion. Hadn't been done yet on a Beatles track. George is playing a proper classical guitar here, beautifully as well. His arpeggio triads during the verses are in double time against the rest of the group as well, giving it an unusual, ornamental meter. You don't hear claves in pop that often either. Had it been done before? They're on The Who's ""Disguises"" as well, but that was two years down the road. I've never really been sure about the middle-eight, which seems a bit ""well, it'll do"" to me. It's also odd that Paul's vocal goes in and out of being double tracked, as is the random major-key change right at the end. But it's a gorgeous song. I've always loved George's opening riff as well. Brooding.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Tell Me Why</strong><br><br>Aaaaaaaand we're back on the ho-hum train. There's like, what, one distinct chord progression for the whole track? And what the hell's up with those falsetto vocals in the middle-eight? Ringo's drum intro is kinda neat, as is Paul's walking bassline, but that's it.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</strong><br><br>Above average, but not super exciting. Same's true of I Want To Hold Your Hand for me. It's anything but a bad track, but it's pretty simple. I mean, it IS based on a twelve-bar blues structure. Usually the boys were a bit more inventive than that. Still, Paul's got that sultry attitude going here that he'd crank to 11 for She's A Woman a few months later. The stop-start in the chorus is a neat trick as well, as is the not-perfectly-tracked doubled guitar solo.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Any Time At All</strong><br><br>Sounds a bit like a With the Beatles leftover, but that descending chromatic progression in the verse is outstanding (as is the B minor-G minor change). Paul's on piano here, though I'm not at all sure about the joint guitar/piano middle eight (which Paul wrote). Seems out of place.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I'll Cry Instead</strong><br><br>Nashville-y. They'd play with this sound again on Beatles For Sale's ""I Don't Want To Spoil The Party"" (which I always confuse with this track, seeing as how they're awfully similar). But yeah, a neat, quick little musical diversion. Whether it was Smokey Robinson and the Miracles or Carl Perkins, they had a knack for showcasing their influences on these earlier records. Also, check out Paul's bass run at 1:05! Holy hell!<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Things We Said Today</strong><br><br>Oh man... one of the most sophisticated Beatles tracks prior to Rubber Soul, this thing is spotless. There are some highly unusual chord substitutions all over the place (notably the jump from Fmaj to Bbmaj instead of the expected Emaj7 or Fm at ""wishing you weren't so <strong class=""rymfmt"">far away</strong>"" in the verse and the drop from Bmaj to Bbmaj instead of the expected Emaj7 at ""love is here to <strong class=""rymfmt"">stay</strong> and that's enough"" in the middle eight). John, oddly, is the one playing piano on this track. For the record, they could all play piano, including Ringo (how'd you think he wrote Octopus's Garden?). The other thing I love is how the jagged, immediate chord-based acoustic guitar playing is contrasted by the quiet, deliberate lead-based electric guitar playing. One of their best.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">When I Get Home</strong><br><br>As with I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, I'm not familiar enough to start ranting-without-notes on it like the other tracks. Gimme a sec.<br><br>...hmm. It's a little similar to I Call Your Name from the Long Tally Sally EP, although not as good IMO. The lyrics are atrocious (""till the cows come home"", John? really now? <em class=""rymfmt"">really</em>?), but John's slightly snotty vocal redeems it a bit, as do the odd (though not ridiculously so) chord changes. The song spends a bunch of its time being hilariously unsure what key it's in, a trick that John (and George occasionally, see Don't Bother Me) would use frequently. It's either in the key of A or C, depending on how strict/traditional your view of harmony is.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">You Can't Do That</strong><br><br>Oh man, I LOVE THIS SONG. Never mind the slightly creepy ""I saw you talking to some guy I don't recognize. Don't ever let me catch you do that again"" subtext, this thing has a serious amount of dissonance going on, which is remarkable as (once again) it's framed in a twelve-bar blues. John's ""I <strong class=""rymfmt"">told you before</strong>"" in F creates a ridiculously strange D7#9, not to mention all the G major chords in the verse are played as G7s, which are normally transitory chords that build up tension to be released on a resolution chord but here don't resolve for four whole bars, giving the whole thing a tense, raucous feel. I also love Paul and George's super-tight call and response backing vocals (a Motown trick. what'd I say about influences up there?). Also features one of my favorite guitar solos of all time, being a goddamned discordant, slashing monstrosity that further adds to the slight garage-punk feel. And here's the kicker: John's playing the solo.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I'll Be Back</strong><br><br>And this, I think, is one of <strong class=""rymfmt"">the</strong> unsung Beatles tracks. My god, this thing's haunting. George goes and grabs the classical guitar from And I Love Her again. The track spends most of its time exploiting the change from Amaj to Am (the entire outro fadeout is <em class=""rymfmt"">just</em> this change), along with one of the most effortlessly brilliant choruses these guys ever did, with a complex-on-paper vocal line that John carries right back into the verse. And that fadeout... mysterious. Sounds simultaneously exotic and familiar.<br><br>Overall notes:<br><br>Had any group before this put out an album made entirely of original compositions where not one of them was absolutely terrible? Is there a track here you couldn't have conceivably made into one side of a single? I mean, sure, I slag a few of these off, but that's because I was born after 1970 when their proper masterpieces had already been released, listened to and lauded, and at that point anything prior to them (read: most early Beatles) is going to look at the very least a bit less developed/brilliant in comparison. Had I been around in 1964, I'm sure this would've been cold water thrown in the collective face of popular music around the world. People who were once kings like Elvis and Sinatra, along with the cute heartthrob singers like Bobby Darin, had to watch their backs now very carefully.

I think if I had to vaguely grasp from the air what the sounds of ‘60s rock were, maybe “I’m Happy Just to Dance With You” comes to the flicked switch. 13 songs here and they all sound the same, and it’s up to you if you like that one song. me, I think maybe I’ve heard McCartney belt his best more than twenty times prior to <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard’s Day Night</em> ever got that first play. that lack of a history should be noted, because, I know that this is <em class=""rymfmt"">the world</em> to some people, and I hardly want to ruin their night.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">'A Hard Day's Night' is arguably the apex from the early years of The Beatles.<br>With even better songwriting than the already great predecessor 'With The Beatles', more variety in the instrumentation, only original songs and unforgettable melodies and refrains this album only features great Pop Rock tracks without taking a break. There is no weak track on here.<br>And this album also features two mega hits by The Beatles, namely 'A Hard Day's Night' and the iconic 'Can't Buy Me Love'. But besides these two songs, there are a few other notable highlights.<br>'I Should Have Known Better', 'Tell Me Why' and especially 'You Can't Do That' are just as great as the two mega hits.<br>I think with this album The Beatles fully developed their own sound, at least for their Merseybeat days, and simulateneously released the go-to album to it. You could only criticize it for the repetetive lyrics and overall standard themes of the songs, but this criticism would totally ignore the time it was released and the position The Beatles were in at these days.<br><br>5 stars</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with doing a lot of covers, provided you're able to either give the song a new voice or a new punch. Of course, the Beatles didn't become more popular than Jesus, Buddha, Allah and the Subgenius combined by being interpreters, so this record is all-original in a bid for integrity (a sentiment that would spread heavily as the psychedelic era approached). After getting to the top in a fashion unheard of, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Days Night</em> (both the film, which is a fun rainy day watch, and this album) did pretty much everything the Beatles had to do, which was push their sound, give more girly-shriek material, and respond to people who don't like The Thing by Increasing The Thing. <br><br>Man, this one is like <em class=""rymfmt"">concentrated</em> Beatles. The sap is even sappier (""And I Love Her"" which is pretty damn beautiful, actually), the harmonies are closer, and even better, they don't need to rely on clumsy charm to get some of their lovey-dovey stuff over, because they carry off sentiment a little better here. Yeah, no corny ""Love Me Do""-type stuff, so you don't have to love anything in a patronizing way. ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" which jams as much pop into twelve-bar blues as humanly possible, shows an emotional strength that would be unthinkable a year ago. <br><br>Maybe this isn't the stylistic breakthrough the boys were steadily building towards, but it does fulfill some of the promise of <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> simply by slyly expanding their palette <em class=""rymfmt"">and</em> one-upping that album by nearly matching the pacing of <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em>. Even the filler (""Tell Me Why"" comes to mind) does a bang-up job of keeping the good times rolling. The brightness of this record only slows down when the Beatles will it to be so. ""Things We Said Today"" and closer ""I'll Be Back"" are surprisingly downtrodden by young Beatles standards, juxtaposing wistful minor keys with glimpses of their usual pop. <br><br>The album, it's said, is largely driven by John Lennon's compositions (only ""And I Love Her,"" ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Things We Said Today"" were Paul McCartney's) but George Harrison and his chiming 12-string gets his fair share of attention - in fact, this album helped popularize the instrument. Notably, George gives extra weight to the otherwise standard fare ""Any Time At All"" (dat bridge) and oh yeah, providing one of the most iconic openings of all time with the title track.<br><br>The Beatles weren't legends yet; they were still a teenage riot instead of a revolution. Besides George helping to give a rough sketch for folk-rock later, this is a pretty great step forward just as a Beatles record. Even better, it's their most consistent batch of songs yet.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a fantastic album! So catchy and fun. Every song on the A side is absolutely killer. The B side is not as good but it still has some great songs like ""Any Time at All"" or the amazing ""Things We Said Today."" I think this an amazing album filled to the brim with incredible songs. There isn't a single bad part on this album in my opinion.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">I would not call this album - it's rather a collection of fine pop-rock tunes, some of which belong to their time and some (and they are many) are definitely going to live forever.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Continuing the Merseybeat pop / rock concoctions of their first two albums, THE BEATLES up their ante after their explosion onto the world scene after their American invasion via The Ed Sullivan show. This is the very first album where they prove to the world that they do not have to rely on covers and indeed can construct an entire album of their own making. After breaking into the stratosphere their confidence level shot through the roof and this was a good thing for it allowed the Fab Four to construct some of the catchiest and memorable 60s rock n roll in their nascent career.<br><br>Side one on HARD DAY'S NIGHT is also the soundtrack to THE BEATLES' hugely successful black-and-white comedy film of the same name starring the Fab Four themselves, performing their own music and escaping the crazed female fans who were throwing themselves as well as their knickers about. The film itself was a huge hit and so was the accompanying album. Side two consists of songs not found on the soundtrack. This was the only album where every track was written by Lennon and McCartney but it was Ringo who came up with the album title. <br><br>This album was a true innovator as it prompted many a folk act to “plug it in” and go electric but also saw some progressive tendencies creep in as with George Harrison's Spanish guitar. This album helped continue THE BEATLES into the spotlight and didn't disappoint one bit. The momentum was strong and HARD DAY'S NIGHT only cemented Beatlemania into the world's consciousness.  The absolute best of their early albums and the only one where I love every track on it. Run, guys! They're catching up to ya!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Ну вот и подошли к кульминации ранние «Битлы».  Могу сказать, что по хронологии выпускаемых пластинок он действительно лучший.  Вообще до третьего альбома «качество» (и звука и текстов)   нарастало (дальше то оно по-всякому будет: и шедевры и середняки, и все как всегда субъективно), а здесь немного такой, что-ли, апогей. <br>Что касается самого альбома. Хотя по-настоящему гениальных для меня вещей здесь не очень много. Тем не менее, альбом вышел  хорошим, значительно выше среднего, фактически нигде не провиснув. <br>Снова было ряд песен между 3.0 и 3.5, но теперь чаша в большинстве склонилась к 3.5. (вот я и говорю, апогей раннего творчества) <br>«Плейлистовых» вещей тут оказалась бОльшая часть альбома, однако отметить отдельным упоминанием почему-то хотелось бы песни: <br>«I Should Have Known Better» (вот вроде не любишь ты губную гармошку, а гармония настолько крутая, что ничего с собой сделать не можешь) и «Any Time at All» (с ее великолепной насыщенностью и неповторимым звучанием). <br>В заключении.<br>Такими как были музыканты здесь, они уже больше никогда не будут. Будут выдержанные в похожем стиле песни, но той сентенции из молодых музыкантов и очень задорной музыки, на таком высоком уровне для меня больше никогда уже не будет. По этому поводу, конечно, можно грустить, но я не стану, ведь не будь поздних «Битлз», ранних, быть может, я бы и не слушал вовсе.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I tried. Getting into the Beatles, I've been trying. I started with this album - poor me.<br><br>The opening track is awesome but the album could end right there. Most of the songs are barely bearable. Stupid boring love songs that might have not sounded generic back in the day but they do today. Oh, well, at least <em class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</em> is kinda decent too.<br><br>I really tried. Maybe other Beatles albums aren't so atrocious. I'll try.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Confession: John might be my least favorite Beatle. He's at least the one who annoys me the most, due in large part to his singing, which too often seems full of the most noxious of self-satisfaction. That his dominance of <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> doesn't peel the enamel off my teeth is testament to the fairly unimpeachable set of melodies on display; that those tunes are stuck with such a uniform rhythmic organization is testament to how the group's priorities rarely coincide with mine. That vapid, unwavering hi-hat clatter may be the best representation of why 1964 is in the running (with 1968, for the record) for The Beatles' worst year.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The third <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles </em>release was a gorgeous pop record, the best one from their Merseybeat era.<strong class=""rymfmt""> A Hard Day's Night</strong> including no more rock &amp; roll covers just original <em class=""rymfmt"">Lennon / McCartney</em> songs. The album - and the film - is a documentation of a band becoming legend. Thanks to the early success of the band <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatlemania </em>at this point peaked high. And the band's gratitude to the audience was 12 nearly perfect pop songs, like the title track or the gentle <em class=""rymfmt"">And I Love Her</em> of the sassy pop <em class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</em>.

This album goes beyond the basic ""soundtrack"" and works well on its own. A must have for any serious collection and a great way to ""discover"" the group beyond thier radio hits. When people think of the early Beatles, THIS is it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Вот это уже прорыв! «Битлы» покорили Америку и снялись в фильме «Вечер трудного дня», который весьма похож на документальную хронику из их жизни, с показом того массового психоза, который был вокруг них. На обложке изображено по 5 фотографий каждого из участников группы – от серьезных до шутливых. Песни, прозвучавшие в фильме, а также еще некоторые, и составили третий альбом The Beatles. Они полностью их собственные – и какие отличные! Даже спустя 40 лет можно восхищаться талантом этих ребят. Леннон сочинил девять композиций: заглавную энергичную «A Hard Day’s Night» (еще один хит), «I Should Have Known Better» (с отличной гармоникой и гитарным рисунком), романтическую «If I Fell», завораживающую «I’m Happy Just to Dance with You» (спета Джорджем; под нее действительно хочется танцевать с любимой девушкой), «Any Time at All» (с запоминающимся припевом), фолковую «I’ll Cry Instead», интересную «You Can’t Do That» (с прикольными ударными), лиричную «I’ll Be Back»; менее всего запоминается «When I Get Home». Вклад Маккартни скромнее: всего 4 темы, но среди них есть настоящие жемчужины – невероятно красивая и медленная «And I Love Her» (великолепная вещь!) и энергичная «Can’t Buy Me Love» (о ее популярности говорит хотя бы тот факт, что ее стали исполнять даже джазмены); «Tell Me Why» довольно стандартна и, видимо, худшая на альбоме, а вот «Things We Said Today» – очень сильна и одна из лучших у Пола. Уже с таким альбомом «Битлы» навечно отметились в мировой музыке, но впереди были еще более интересные работы.<br><br>Рецензия написана 20 марта 2005 года</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">""A Hard Day's Night"" continues the style and production of ""With The Beatles"", except this time with a more upbeat and chirpy tone. The result is an improvement, with a solid collection of good pop tunes that can't be called groundbreaking, yet can't be sniffed at.<br><br>The focus is what makes it different, as the band are focusing on the sound of the group as a whole, rather than just the beat or the harmony. Perhaps that is what makes the music strong, as the performance and production improves the music greatly. Whatever the reason, the Beatles don't disappoint with another good strong effort.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I gotta say, I am not really much of a fan of the immensely overrated Can't Buy Me Love, but IMO this was likely the best album ever recorded when this was released in 1964 and likely wasn't topped until The Beatles released Sgt Peppers in 1967, but after that almost every Beatles album was a masterpiece. To me they clearly put way more into this than their second album, and they're clearly just better all around here than they were for their first. To my ears there are very few albums in history to contain four 4.5 star songs, this is one of them.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Ouf, c’est reparti dans le bon sens ! J’étais quand même sacrément déçu par ce second album. Je remarque que je connais pas mal des titres présents sur cet opus, ce qui est bon signe puisqu’à part une petite compil de mon cru des titres les plus populaires, je tiens à rappeler que je ne connais pas du tout les Beatles.<br><br>Donc comme tout le monde (je suppose), je connais les classiques tels que « A hard day’s night », « Can’t buy me love » ou l’excellente « Any time at all ». Par contre, je découvre la très belle « And I love her » (dommage que le solo soit foiré), la très triste « Things we said today » ou encore la très enthousiaste « When I get home ». Pas des références ultimes, mais très sympathiques à exhumer.<br><br>Un album encore peu mature à mon goût, que ce soit musicalement ou au niveau des paroles, encore sacrément faibles. Que me réserve le prochain album ? Encore un truc pour pucelles ou enfin l’un des chefs d’œuvre dont tout le monde parle ? A suivre…</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Solid album, favorite on the album is probably I'm Happy Just to Dance With You (what can I say, George rocks!)</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This one has the best flow of their first 4 albums.  The mellow songs are great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Rating by Song Average: 3.7<br><br>Rating by Album: 3.6<br><br>This album is the Beatles at their most endearingly average possible incarnation. There's little to nothing that I DISlike about this album however very little of it is memorable at all let alone classic material. A hurtle from With but also a faaaar Hurtle down from the likes of Rubber Soul.<br><br>What saves this album from being bad is Paul's excellent instincts as a bassist and John's signature way of displaying the band. This is one of the Albums I could've seen being a very good ""Johnny and the Moondog's"" release. George also added mature solowork to his steady ascent to Godhood at this milestone.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">----------------------------------<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Pros</strong><br>----------------------------------<br><br>+ It's amazing how sometimes you hear certain songs so often that you become completely oblivious to the details in them. All of sudden after listening #4096 of <em class=""rymfmt"">""A Hard Day's Night""</em>, I just noticed Ringo's crazy bongos and cowbell. <br><br>+ Has the hits <em class=""rymfmt"">""A Hard Day's Night""</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">""And I Love Her""</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">""Can't Buy Me Love""</em>. All classics from this era of the band. <br><br>+ For the second-tier tracks. <em class=""rymfmt"">""Anytime At All""</em> is the standout. Lennon's vocal is its most impassioned on the album. Nifty Harrison guitar solo at the end of the track too. <br><br>+ The fantastic bridge in <em class=""rymfmt"">""Things We Said Today""</em> is something only a band like the Beatles could come up with. It's also a little hint of where their sound was starting to move to.<br><br>----------------------------------<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Cons</strong><br>----------------------------------<br><br>- The Merseybeat Beatles, while obviously great and hugely influential, were always the least interesting and consequential of any of their phases. I think you need to have a bit of passion for this era of music for ""A Hard Day's Night"" to have much replay value.  <br><br>- Some pretty lightweight material on here. <em class=""rymfmt"">""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You""</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">""Tell Me Why""</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">""I'll Cry Instead""</em> are all fluff.<br><br>- Yeah, I know it's the Beatles, and that in comparison to other pop music that was being made at the time, that this album, soundtrack or not, overshadowed pretty much the lot of it. Unfortunately, unlike say Bob Dylan's music from the same time, ""A Hard Day's Night"" feels dated.<br>  <br>----------------------------------<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Verdict:</strong> mildly recommended</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Perhaps I'm being anal, but it really bugs me that this is mixed in mono, and yes, I know it's 1964, but still...<br>Anyway, great songs though. When I get around to listening to a stereo mix of this, I'll most probably give it at least 4 stars. This is probably the first of the Beatles' really great albums.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog.</em><br><br>The Beatles, a pop rock group praised relentlessly and critically acclaimed. While I may not be a huge fan of the ""Fab Four"", I can at the least see why some of their more innovative records have the acclaim they do. Most of it is fun, colorful and bizarre, and highly intriguing. However, one thing I do resent is the fact that their fanbase literally thinks <em class=""rymfmt"">everything </em>they touch is the epitome of music and has no flaws. <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is one of the best examples of this.<br><br>Let me explain, if this album had the exact same lyrics, compositions, harmonies, everything, but had One Direction's name smacked on it, it'd get 0.5/1.0 ratings out the wazoo. <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is literally an album full of melody driven, 2 minute pop songs all about girls and love, two generic topics that are rarely ever executed right (by boy bands at least). The lyrics are all ""I love you"", ""I want you to love me"", love this, love that, love love love, and nothing more.<br><br>I suppose it could be much, much worse, but <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is one of those albums that's bold that I honestly can't stand. The subject matter is completely shallow and one-dimensional, the lyrics are beyond obnoxious, and the melodies are rarely catchy and dry out very quickly. However, it could be a lot more embarrasing than it is. It's nice to see that the Beatles evolved to make some excellent pieces of work in the future, but their early discography is teen pop puke. Boy band drivel, forgettable garbage, annoying performances that really should only appeal to teenage girls. It's a huge wonder why this album is anywhere near RYM's top 500. Oh, that's right, everything that the Beatles make is genius, right?<br><br>★½</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A vaguely patchy hybrid of soundtrack and standard album. A good pop album for the era, but they could do much better.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles - A Hard Days Night<br><br>7.5<br><br>In one way or another, almost every Beatles' album shows steady evolution, but their third album is remarkable in its progress. It's all original material for the first time and it showcases the bands maturity and the development of their distinctive sound. The singles ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" are infectious gems that show uncanny pop sensibility. This is mostly Lennons album with him penning 10 of the 13 tracks, but Paul's contribution ""And I Love Her"" likely shows the most rapid growth of the band. It is a subtle and sophisticated ballad that is most significant in that it simply demonstrates the rising quality of songwriting within the band.  Many still thought they were a passing fad at this point but at this point its becoming easier to blame the critics for failing to see the evolution of the band. However, that's easy to say when you have the benefit of hindsight, and with it comes the realization that the Beatles were prolifically turning out hits while honing their craft at every turn. I actually think Help is a little underrated, but this is still my pick for the best pre-Rubber Soul Beatles' album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A short, pleasant album. Favorite is “Tell Me Why,” the album’s most energetic. Least favorite is “You Can’t Do That,” which is just too shitty and disrespectful to be redeemed by the music.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Lennon es mi beatle favorito, siempre iba un paso adelante que el McCartney (quien tampoco era malo). Muestra de que era mas chingón, son las 10 de 13 canciones que tiene el <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>.<br><br>Más acústicos que en sus dos anteriores discos, aunque tiene temas rockeros como la gran ""You Can't Do That"", “Tell Me Why” y la que da titulo al disco. Del McCartney destaca “Things We Said Today”.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">After two albums of 14 tracks it'd be easy to think they skimped on this one with only 13 songs, plus the whole thing is over in just 30 minutes. However, there are no covers this time so they actually produced more new material.<br><br>Whilst the opening riff of the title track is iconic, it's the second track that's the main highlight for me and I always associate the medley from <a title=""[Album30275]"" href=""/release/album/stars_on_45/stars_on_long_play/"" class=""album"">Stars on Long Play</a> with 'I Should Have Known Better'. Somehow I'm always waiting for that 19 second snippet.<br><br>Interestingly, while the second side really belongs to Lennon, the best song is the sole McCartney track, the 'Things We Said Today'. I defy anyone who'd never heard this to guess that it'd been produced in 1964. I don't get that feeling with Lennon's songs although the last two have some good moments. Still, I get confused listening to the full versions due to that cursed Stars on 45 medley. Why did it have to be so catchy?</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's not the Beatles' greatest album - that would come later - but it's a vital release in their catalogue.<br><br>Composed entirely of originals, it redefined what being a rock 'n roll artist could be about, and set the course for the future ahead of how important music from this era was going to have.<br><br>The cultural impact cannot be understated, but neither can the quality of the songs - the band are simply on fire in the studio, from the opening title track to the finale.<br><br>Melodies are fired off with impunity and ease, as the Beatles give a real indication of just how brilliant they are going to become.<br><br>It's the album where they really come into their own, and from here on in they would not look back, but forge ahead to be, arguably, the greatest band of all time.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">the only slightly 'iffy' song is ""When I Get Home"".... it's the one i always knock off when i used to record this album to cassette, as it clocked in at just over 30 minutes. If this was replaced with, say, ""I Wanna Be Your Man"" then yeah.......<br><br>they will always be the greatest band ever.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">The most popular beatle album from their early era,the era when the term beatlemania was introduced in the world.The pressure that was coming from their sudden huge and impressive success is visible in both the movie and the album.Also it's their first album which is entirely written by them,no covers here no Ringo song too,the first and the last time.That wont happen again,they will always find a little space for Ringo in the future<br><br><br><br>A hard day's night it's a hurried and rowdy album but still enjoyable with some really memorable moments.It's probably the loudest beatle album.As heretic as it may sounds  i think it is, mainly cause of Lennon's harsh vocals.Speaking of Lennon this is the album in which  he has contributed more than any other beatle album,not necessarily in terms of quality but in terms of quantity, he has the lead vocals in 9 out of 13 songs while Paul has them in 3 and George in 1.It is difficult to say how much help did John have from Paul for each song,in those days John was more dominant and clearly the leader of the band and they worked together more than later,so he may took some extra credits,even with that, Paul sines by having the albums 2 best songs (and i love her and cant buy me love) and by harmonizing beautifully John in the if i fell song.Paul adds the tender vocals that the song needs,while John's warm vocals make the song unique.<br><br>if all my loving was their first pop ''masterpiece'',and i love her is their first ''quality'' song ,probably the most classy melancholic love song written by the beatles.The last song i want to mention is i should have known better,i really love the rhythm,the guitars,the harmonica,nice stuff!i rated the same as hard day's night but sincerely i enjoy it much more ,i rarely enjoy a hard day's night now.<br><br>Finally the album cover is iconic in pop culture like sgt pepper.If you gonna put their 3 most original album covers you have to put this along with abbey road and sgt pepper<br><br>As for how much i play the record.Sometimes i really love the album but most of the times i find it tiring cause of it's ''loudness''<br><br>3.5/5 it's The Beatles after all in their glory!!!</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><strong class=""rymfmt"">Summary:</strong><br>A marked improvement on the band's first two albums, but let down by a weak second side.

Gedaan met de rock’n roll- en Motowncovers. Vanaf nu zouden ze hun eigen muziek bepalen en daarmee meteen ook alle concurrentie steeds een stap vooruit blijven. Het meest innovatieve aan dit album is de introductie van George Harrisons gitaar met 12 snaren. Dat gaf zo een nieuw en uniek geluid dat elke zichzelf respecterende groep vanaf 1965 dit probeerde te evenaren. Een innovatief geluid maakt echter nog niet meteen een goed album. Het is niet meteen hun plaat met de bekendste nummers maar het is een 13 nummers en een half uur lang durend album met frisse popnummers, originele ballads en uiteraard de nummers A Hard Day’s Night en Can’t Buy Me Love. Je kan de gillende meiden er zo doorheen denken. The Beatles was al een popfenomeen, maar met dit album zetten ze pas echt een stap naar absolute wereldheerschappij. Wel opletten: de eerste 7 songs komen ook voor in de gelijknamige film, maar de rest van de nummers werden voor de Amerikaanse uitgave vervangen door instrumentals. Oppassen dus als je vinyl verzamelt: ga op zoek naar de Britse uitgave.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is where they started getting good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles decided to record music for a film low budget film, which featured themselves as main characters. In England “A Hard Day’s Night” was released as regular album and in the states as soundtrack from the film company “United Artist” since Capital Records, the label of the Beatles wasn’t allowed to sell records in the USA.<br><br>The Beatles had to record all songs before the making of the film started so they were under pressure but the Fab Four were able to put the whole album together before the work for the movie started. As usual all songs were written by guitarist John Lennon and bassist Paul McCartney, especially John Lennon wrote a lot of songs for this record, 10 out of 13 songs were mainly written by him. <br>“A Hard Day’s Night” is probably the best Beatles album from the early days it includes a lot of great songs such as the well known “Can’t Buy Me Love”, “Any Time at All”, which is probably my favorite tune of this album, the final “I’ll Be Back”, “Things We Said Today” and the opening title track “A Hard Day’s Night”.<br><br>I never saw the movie but the soundtrack is great and as I said the best album from the Beatles early days, the Merseybeat Era.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Great guitar and melody driven pop/rock with some well thought melodies and catchyness. Very sing along friendly, and most of the tracks on this album are top notch potential hit material. Really good vocal melodies and harmonies. Genious composing used. <br><br>Even though it's quite straight forward, there's just so many elements in this and everything just seem to fit together perfectly. Brilliance!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">One of the best pop albums ever made and certainly one of the best of the era, A Hard Day's Night is overflowing with outstanding songwriting, fantastic vocal deliveries and harmonies, and energy.   Perhaps it all sounds simplistic now, next to the extreme eclecticism of today's rock and pop music - but those deviations from the norm wouldn't have happened without a well-established foundation from which to deviate, and this album is about as strong a definitive statement of that foundation as it's possible to make.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Huh. Again, not a really convincing album by the four mushroomheads, as we Germans lovingly call them. ""A Hard Day's Night"" is a bloody terrific song for sure, but after this opener... err... well, there are a few nice songs here and there, especially the truly beautiful, haunting ballad ""Things We Said Today"", but none of them really leaves a mark. Once again, every single song is just about teenie-weenie-heartache problems! After 30+ songs in one year about the same theme, that just doesn't sound convincing to me in any way.<br><br>Okay, the songwriting... yes, the songwriting is okay, even quite amibitious at times, but when I listen to their late-1964 singles, I get a strong feeling that their songwriting skills only started to take off after this album. When their US experiences made them confident enough to leave the teenie sound and themes. Anyway, after two quite disappointing and uninspired Beatles albums, I'm thinking the quality will go up from now...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">So this is the first Beatles album with only original songs. Well, I'm quite divided about it. For one, the Beatles, again, do nothing but teenie-weenie pop songs, and I find this pretty boring and don't see much artistic value or substance in it. Of course, the songwriting is quite ambitious and even quite daring compared to other pop/rock of its day, so I can understand the album's high status. And it's definitively not a bad album. But it's also an album that I don't find very interesting in any way.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Her sker det første skift i bandets lyd og udtryk - der er skruet (en lille smule) ned for den lallede pop, og i højere grad forsøger man sig her (med kæmpe succes) med dybe, velskrevede, velspillede ballader og balanceret poprock - en sikker topkarakter hvis ikke det havde været for den svage afslutning, der desværre bærer præg af at man lige skulle fylde vinylen op.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Their third album is the first release exclusively with original material by Lennon &amp; McCartney. It's also the motion picture soundtrack (side 1) to the movie of the same name, starring The Beatles as themselves. Although most of the songs are written by John Lennon, the three McCartney pieces, are all prominent highlights. From the accoustic riff (by George Harrison) on 'And I Love Her', to the uptempo hit number 'Can't Buy Me Love' and the impressive presentation of 'Things We Said Today'. Lennon shines on the title track and especially on the slow ballad 'If I Fell', as well as on the cool 'Any Time at All' and the catchy lament 'You Can't Do That'.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">An half of the tracks are too cheesy for my tastes, but the other one is a text book about writing pop melodies.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The same speech I've done with Help! Not bad, but great albums are made different! :)</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not a single really interesting song on this one, but it's still The fucking Beatles so it deserves at least 8/10 rating.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like the majority of Beatles releases, this is a cracker of a record. It's not the most lauded of the fab fours albums but that is mainly down to relativity. This is a great pop/rock n roll record and arguably their best pre 1965 release.  Outside of the singles everyone will know (A Hard Day's Night, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love), you've got classics like ""Things we said today"", ""If I Fell"",''You can't do that"" and ""Anytime At All"". Tune after tune after tune. Highly recommended.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Great album. ""A Hard Day's Night"" is one of my favorite Beatles songs.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is hailed as an early Beatles classic but I can't see it. For one there is too much Lennon here. Ringo doesn't get any songs here but Harrison sings one of Lennon's. This wouldn't be a problem but most of his songs sound very similar musically and lyrically (even for the Beatles) and it ends up sounding repetitive. Verdict: though there are some great songs here (title track, If I Fell, Can't Buy Me Love) this is one of their more overrated albums.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No matter how many call this the first great album by <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> this isn't much different from their previous highly inconsistent albums. Pretty average. <br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Overall: 2.62</strong></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles Hard days night is for some reason my favorite Beatles album. I don't necessarily think its the best musically. I just love the way it starts out and each song is perfectly arranged.  If I haven't listened to the Beatles in awhile, this is usually the first album I turn to.  So many classics on this one.  I don't rate it perfect because the second half of the album is not as good for me.  I do enjoy ALL the songs.  Its just a few on the second part are less then perfect to me.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Fun stuff. Kind of unfair that when John Lennon was doing his spiteful tough gruff sneery and leery thing and not wearing glasses on purpose and groaning spitefully to frenetic melodies on a stage in black and white, as he does here, Paul McCartney was perfectly happy to support him by bopping around like a six-foot hamster howling little hollyhocks of harmony but then when it was Paul's time to shine John broke up the band. ""And I Love Her"" might be their best song.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Hugely underrated album.  They're pre 'Rubber Soul' moptop stuff really doesn't get enough love.  Even though it only runs to half an hour, there is more in this than some bands put into their whole career.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">So this was their breakthrough album. It is a loud and fun pop album, but it really likes the sophistication in their next albums that made them larger than life really. THe album starts of great with the title track, and ""cant buy me love"" is really the other classic i would point out here. As for the rest of the songs it is way too much sugar coated happy ballads, which i guess can get a bit annoying. Overal still listenable but a pretty average album from the 60's.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The best side of the UK record mixed with some tasteful, pleasant, and wistful instrumentals of ""And I Love Her"" and ""This Boy"". Can't go wrong with this 'un.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">This is one of the albums that makes me desperately want to have lived in the 60s, it's that great! I've always laughed at those girls who screamed and cried like mad when listening to The Beatles (or any other artist or band), but I understand it now. They are just perfect.<br><br>Favourite songs: all, but ""tell Me Why"" and ""When I Get Home""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A major step forward for the Beatles, and their first album consisting entirely of their own material. The most important advance here is in the clean break between the Four and their influences; all of the tracks feel rooted in the 60s rather than harking back to earlier eras of rock and roll. The title track and Can't Buy Me Love are the best of the straight-ahead rockers, whilst Things We Said Today, I'm Happy Just to Dance With Her and others show a far greater emotional and musical range than their first two albums display. Tracks such as You Can't Do That show a harder edge that may be inspired by the emergence of the Rolling Stones and other rivals; certainly, the boys are not content to produce a third iteration of Please Please Me here. What they do produce is their first wall-to-wall no-filler classic album. Particularly of note is George Harrison's use of 12-string and Spanish guitar, introducing a new sound into a rock context, a simple innovation with profound consequences.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">First listened - August 4 2008<br><br>My favorite old-school Beatles album. It's awesome, and so is the movie.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The third Beatles album and (Quiz Fans) the first featuring all original songs and the only one where all the songs are by Lennon &amp; McCartney (Although 9 of the 13 are by Lennon apparently) and one of three where Ringo does not get a vocal. The longest track is 2:35 and the whole album us 30:45. Anyway forget the statistics because this is simply great.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The title track, ""I Should Have Known Better,"" and ""Things We Said Today"" are the stand-outs for me, but everything else is solid.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is my favorite rock lp and gets my vote for The Beatles' best. My thoughts:<br><br>1. Out of the 13 songs here I would rate 8 or 9 as classics. Some of the lp cuts here are better than some of the Beatles' later 45 issues (I'll take ""I'll be Back"" over ""Hello Goodbye"" anytime). The songwriting is phenomenal, especially considering the circumstances in which they were written.<br><br>2. The only songs that don't make the classic category for me are ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"", ""I'll Cry Instead"", ""Anytime at All"", and ""When I Get Home"", which is probably the worst song (a few too many ""whoa oh ho ha's""). I am on the fence on ""You Can't Do That."" In any case all these songs are perfectly acceptable and enjoyable lp tracks. <br><br>3. The band is in top form, both instrumental and vocally. They sound tight and inspired, and I think this is their top performance on lp. ""Tell Me Why"", which really is not a great composition, reaches classic status simply due to the transcendent performance. For the most part, they simply did their songs better than anyone else could, and they have never been given sufficient credit as performers.<br><br>4. While this is the definitive ""Fab Four"" lp, hints of their mature sound are beginning to creep in. Musically, it is not a stretch to imagine ""I'll be Back"", ""If I Fell"" or ""Things We Said Today"" on Rubber Soul.<br><br>5. They were still not the greatest lyricists. Many of their early lyrics were sound simply tossed off and they do not tell a story or show much in the line of cleverness. Sometimes they barely manage to seem coherent. ""I've got a chip on my shoulders bigger than my feet"" is the notorious example here, but the beautiful ""And I Love Her"" is almost torpedoed by the trite lyrics. Thanks to Dylan and others for inspiring them to work harder on this aspect of their compositions.<br><br>6. Many of these songs were released in the U.S. on the United Artists soundtrack lp, which contained orchestral selections, and on Something New. This UK version is the one to get.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">#182 All Time Album (acclaimedmusic.net)<br><br>I've been stuck (but very content!) with ""Rubber Soul"" onwards, so I've never bothered looking at their earlier work. I think it was a mistake to completely forget their previous records, but if I'm honest The Beatles were a band which grew from record to record. There was such a massive leap from Rubber Soul to Revolver that ""A Hard Days Night"" seems really mediocre in comparison. It's not <em class=""rymfmt"">bad</em>, the record is pleasant enough, but it's not breaking boundaries like their later stuff. It's all pretty much love songs, and it gets a bit boring. <br><br>Favourite Tracks: ""If I Fell"", ""And I Love Her"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""You Can't Do That""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's a pity all the songs are teeny love songs. Different subject matter occasionally surely wouldn't have hurt. <br><br>'And I Love Her' has always been one of my favorite Beatles songs.</span>"

Su fama y popularidad eran ya cuestión de estado, y se les intentaba vender (explotar) con todo tipo de merchandising, pero ellos aprovechaban cualquier ocasión para sacar petroleo de donde menos se lo esperaban.

Es el único disco en el que se rompe un poco el binomio, siendo claramente Lennon el que lleva con sus creaciones el peso del álbum, dejando solo tres canciones para el resto.<br><br>Su vida era una autentica locura, vivían recluidos y sin tiempo libre, pero su talento seguía intacto, y facturaban disco tras disco esa sensación de que lo grande estaba a punto de llegar.<br><br>7.5/10<br><br>BLOG: <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://45yomusic.blogspot.com"" target=""_blank"">http://45yomusic.blogspot.com</a><br>FORO: <a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://45yomusic.comuv.com"" target=""_blank"">http://45yomusic.comuv.com</a></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">My first experience with <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist""> The Beatles</a> ever. It's their first album contains purely original <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist""> The Beatles</a> songs. It was released in 1964, the year of Beatles, during Beatlemania, they filmed a same named film and this album should confrim their popularity. And it certainly succeeded. <br><br>I like the first side. It contains music from the film and I can say, almost every of that songs is still big hit. The first one is my favourite <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist""> The Beatles</a> song ever. <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, a rebeling, hard-rocking song. The rebel guitar riff, rolling rhythm of percussion instruments, booming bass and the voice of <em class=""rymfmt"">John Lennon</em>, which is routed in the chorus with <em class=""rymfmt"">Paul McCartney</em>, this is the whole thing. The next song is lead by blown harmonica, it is well known, mainly because of the biggest <a title=""[Artist8]"" href=""/artist/the-beatles"" class=""artist""> The Beatles</a> weapon - the harmonies. They are still the kings (and probably will be forever) of this important thing and I never heard better and catchiest harmonies. They almost devise perfect harmony in every song. The songs are easy listening pop rock, nothing experimental, which was optimal for that time. The ballads just like <em class=""rymfmt"">If I Feel</em>, work too. The last song on the first side <em class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</em> is my another favourite song. I like the verse more than a chorus which is strange. The song starts with chorus which is also strange. Also the solo by <em class=""rymfmt"">George Harrison</em> is not bad. <br><br>So that is the first side, a good one. The second side is worse, but although it starts good. The first song is good. But with <em class=""rymfmt"">I'll Cry Instead</em> it comes. It is the first song on album that starts bored me. <em class=""rymfmt"">Things We Said Today</em> sounds like some western theme. I don't like it. The next song should be a good rocker, but instead of it is very boring because of ""wououha"" refrain. The next one is better, but still not reach the quality of first side. But I like the line ""because I told you before"". The last song <em class=""rymfmt"">I'll Be Back</em> is classic with good atmosphere, great for the end. <br><br>Overall it is solid album, not my cup of tea, but I don't have any problem with it. Too bad the second side is not so good, like the first one.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">fucking genius, better than the white album!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">With this album, their third, The Beatles ditched their previous (and highly successful) formula of roughly half originals, half covers, and delivered an album that consisted purely of originals. The effect, of course, was that it was a huge improvement, because all the originals from their previous albums were better than the covers; and with this one too, we can see another step forward with their songwriting skills. Their rock and roll tracks are just as fresh today as they were in '64 (A Hard Day's Night, Can't Buy Me Love), and they successfully covered a lot of other musical territory too, with great ballads (And I Love Her, If I Fell) and other generally diverse compositions (You Can't Do That, I'll Be Back). This album is another milestone for The Beatles, and I pity anyone who has not enjoyed it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Released as a movie, this album's first side includes music off the film. <br>It starts off with that famous opening chord of <strong class=""rymfmt"">'A Hard Day's Night' </strong>and it's as effective an intro to an album as any. The sound of that chord is so intriguiging that you cant help but listen on and when you do you get to hear that great rhythm guitar from John Lennon and eventually that piano and guitar unison solo. So catchy and it sounds years ahead of its time. The title track is without a doubt the best album song they had released by this time. <br> Then comes <strong class=""rymfmt"">'I Should Have Known Better'</strong>. In my mind it's a fun song but i dont rate i that highly. I just dont dig the beginning of the vocal melody with the extended 'Iiiiiiiiiiiiii'. Still a fun listen though.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'If I Fell'</strong> is a really pretty and beautiful song with great vocals from McCartney and Lennon. I like how the song flows from the intro to that lovely verse melody.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'I'm Happy Just to Dance with You'</strong> is a pretty cute song and i like the backing vocals of McCartney and Lennon.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'And i love her'</strong> is another great mellow moment of this album with that intro riff instantly recognisable after the first time you listen to it. And it probably has my favourite lyrics, ""bright are the stars that shine, dark is the sky/ i know this love of mine will never die"". Just beautiful on all levels.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'Tell Me Why' </strong> is again a fun listen and reminds me of their first two LPs in the sense that though its a fun listen it just doesnt have that depth to it. I really dont like the bit where they sing like a bunch of school children. It's kind of lame and is my low point of the album.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'Can't Buy Me Love'</strong> was a huge success as a single and it's clear. It has such a great guitar solo and the melody is really exciting and goes further than 'Tell Me Why' in terms of melody. That's the difference between an adequate album track and a hit single - the melody sticks more and it goes somewhere. 'Tell Me Why' was an example of pretty lazy songwriting to be honest, i didnt feel the chorus melody was good enough to be repeated twice. This song probably has the best implementation of the 12 bar blues structure ive heard, including an original, fun, catchy melody. One of their greatest early songs.<br><br>The second side of the album is slightly less impressive. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">'Any Time at All'</strong> is ok but i dont really like the flow of the song from the hook to the verse. Not their most memorable song and <strong class=""rymfmt"">'I'll Cry Instead'</strong> isnt that great, cos i've heard that kind of melody over those chords a million times.<br> One of the most notable songs from the second side is <strong class=""rymfmt"">'Things we Said Today' </strong>which is really catchy and original with a great bridge which has a major key change, going from ballad to rock and back again.<br> I really like <strong class=""rymfmt"">'When i Get Home' </strong>which is similar to 'Any Time at All' because of the rocking hook followed by the bright poppy verse. This works better in terms of flow though for me. <br> I think that <strong class=""rymfmt"">'You Can't Do That' </strong>is really undervalued as a song, that rocking riff from Harrison really gets you going and those harsh stalker-like vocals from Lennon showcase him beginning to become more rocky on this album. On some of the verses, those backing vocals are really exquisite and get you mouthing along. They are so harsh and cool to listen to. The climax of the song is that great guitar solo which is performed by Lennon on this track. Probably my favourite non-A-side on the album.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt"">'I'll Be Back' </strong>is quite a sad song about someone leaving their partner. The subject matter is matched perfectly by the music on here. My only drawback to this is the middle 8 'I thought that i would realise'. It doesnt really cut the mustard for me.<br><br>My Top 5- <br>1. Can't Buy Me Love<br>2. A Hard Day's Night<br>3. You Can't Do That<br>4. And I Love Her <br>5. Things We Said Today<br><br>My Bottom 3-<br>1. I'll Cry Instead<br>2. Tell Me Why<br>3. Any Time at All<br><br>A Hard Day's Night was the Beatles' first LP to not feature any covers. Some would see this as a good thing but in my opinion, this kind of means that they had to write more songs. Since their covers were used as filler, this album made up for the lack of covers with a few fairly average songs. 'I'll Cry Instead' and 'Tell Me Why' are pretty poor by Beatles standards. However there are some really great great songs on here and this far outdoes Please Please Me and is definitely more sophisticated than their two previous releases.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Un álbum positivo, con canciones que dan buen rollo. Mi preferida es ""I Should Have Known Better"".</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Part of the immense influence of the Beatles was to make bands ashamed of not writing their own songs.  You can argue about whether the impact of this was positive or negative, but what is clear is that it tends to obscure the fact that the cover songs are some of the high points of the Beatles' own early albums - a massive <em class=""rymfmt"">Twist and Shout</em>, chiming cyclic <em class=""rymfmt"">You Really Got a Hold On Me</em>, ranting, berserk <em class=""rymfmt"">Rock &amp; Roll Music</em>, brilliantly cynical <em class=""rymfmt"">Money</em>, brash and glitzy <em class=""rymfmt"">Kansas City</em> to name a handful.  <br><br>So forget about the fact that <strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night </strong>is their first entirely self penned LP and note instead that it's probably (with the exception of the couldn't-care-less Yellow Submarine ) their weakest.  <br><br>Its highpoints rely on a mixture of fine shading and undeniably exciting vocal and instrumental flourishes - <em class=""rymfmt"">that</em> chord and the contrast between the Lennon and McCartney vocal sections in the title track; the brisk soulfulness of <em class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</em>; the abrupt shifts between wistful disbelief and bold self assertion in <em class=""rymfmt"">Things We Said Today</em>; the delighted proto-funk and finger-wagging sass of <em class=""rymfmt"">You Can't Do That</em>.  Yet as songs they are not quite what they might seem at first - have any of them ever been successfully covered? <br><br>Then there are the weaker tracks - the popular but feeble ballads and monotonous George feature that featured in the movie, and the minor, transitional work on side 2 recorded in the first wave of success in America.  They are essentially filler, and it was the bracing encounter with Bob Dylan (musically and in person) that broke them out of this encroaching complacency.<br><br>Cover versions returned for the next album but were gradually edged out as the group gained more and more confidence in its own material.  In retrospect in seems a shame - wouldn't <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be</em> have been a stronger proposition if they had taken the covers seriously rather than jamming them into abstraction?</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Algunos califican a A hard day’s night como un avance para el grupo, pero debo confesar que no diría lo mismo. Si bien hay un pequeño cambio estilístico, es sólo un cambio, no un avance. Los Beatles siguen haciendo música juvenil y fresca, todavía no tienen ese grano de gran creatividad que más adelante los hará componer grandes obras (sí, aunque no lo crean hay discos del grupo que me encantan), y sólo se dedican a componer canciones pop, alguna que otra balada a veces acústica, y otros country, pareciéndose su estilo más al de Please please me que al de With the Beatles.<br>  Lo que tengo que reconocer de éste LP es la pequeña muestra de madurez que da el grupo al estrenar todas canciones propias compuestas por Lennon y McCartney.<br>  Los de Liverpool siguen teniendo un éxito rotundo que les permitió filmar una película titulada igual que éste disco, donde se utilizan los primeros siete temas de éste.<br><br>  Un acorde abre <strong class=""rymfmt"">A hard day’s night</strong>, un pop rápido, simpático, entretenido, bailable y plagado de melodías maravillosas que no me deja otra opción más que marcarlo como highlight.<br>  El nivel del disco baja abruptamente con I shold have known better, una canción con melodías poco destacables y una voz duplicada irritable. Podría haber estado como tema normal, pero la repetición la hace una de las canciones más monótonas del disco.<br>  La hermosa balada <strong class=""rymfmt"">If I fell</strong> llega invadiéndonos los oídos con melodías dulces, románticas, sublimes y amables. Otro highlight a la lista.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">I’m just happy to dance with you</strong> es la canción más rockera del disco, con una guitarra rápidamente rasgueada y algo distorsionada y melodías intrascendentes, salvo en el estribillo, donde los coros “Ohhh!” hacen soporte a una entusiasmante línea vocal.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">And I love her</strong> es la balada acústica de la que hablaba. Posee melodías poco destacables, un acompañamiento pacífico y un lindo solo de guitarra acústica.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Tell me why</strong> es buenísima, y empieza con unos coros movidos extremadamente pegadizos  al estilo del tema homónimo, y sigue con esas irresistibles melodías que tanto abundan en la obra Beatle.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Can’t buy me love</strong>, el primer tema compuesto por McCartney, es un pop con influencias bluseras (escuchen el bajo) que tiene un estribillo muy pegadizo, ícono de la canción. Señores, permítanme anunciar este momento con epicidad: (silencio mortal, miradas frías, gran tensión en el ambiente) Se escucha el primer solo realmente bueno, entusiasmante y verdaderamente destacable de George (aplausos y exclamaciones de festejos, múltiples corchos de champagnes destapados a manera de celebración, y borrachos cantando para expresar su alegría). Se habían escuchado algunos punteos buenos en los anteriores LP’s, pero no se comparan con el corto pero efectivísimo solo de esta canción.<br>  Ya está, basta de alegría, porque <strong class=""rymfmt"">Any time at all</strong> nos hace dormir. Ninguna melodía destacable y repeticiones innecesarias hacen que marque este tema como lowlight. George nos decepciona con un solo acompañado del piano de Martin, somnoliento e inexpresivo, para variar.<br> <strong class=""rymfmt""> I’ll cry instead</strong> es un country no muy destacable pero disfrutable en fin.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">Things we said today</strong> es otra de las canciones normales e intrascendentes del disco, con estrofas que poseen una melodía con un deje de misterio y un estribillo entusiasmante pero nada más.<br>  Si tienen un taladro a mano, háganme caso: úsenlo en sus orejas para no escuchar <strong class=""rymfmt"">When I get home</strong>. Está bien, el coro es simpático, ¡pero no se puede resistir tanto tiempo a una idea musical tan escasa! Irritable.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">You can’t do that</strong> es el ultimo highlight del disco, y posee estrofas muy buenas y divertidas, con un estribillo de iguales características y un gran solo de George.<br>  <strong class=""rymfmt"">I’ll be back</strong> es un pop algo dramático y mediocre. Las estrofas ni siquiera son entusiasmantes, divertidas o interesantes. Aburrimiento puro que encima se hace infinito por la cantidad de repeticiones. <br><br>  Si bien el primer LP sigue siendo el mejor de los tres, éste muestra una ligera mejoría, al haber más highlights.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Puntuación: 6+<br><br>Mejor tema: A hard day's night<br><br>Highlights:</strong> A hard day's night; If I fell; Tell me why; Can't buy me love; You can't do that.<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Lowlights:</strong> I have should known better; Any time at all; When I get home; I'll be back.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a perfect pop album. Every song has so much energy in it. This album is full of life. This is life music.<br><br>And the songs all sound distinctive which is a great quality for a pop album (and an impressive one when you consider how simplistic all these songs are).<br><br>My first favorite Beatles album, though it's in third place now behind the White Album and Revolver. Still, the best of their pre-Rubber Soul period by far.<br><br>Watch the movie too. It's just as fun as the album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This album is better than ""Please Please Me"" or ""With The Beatles"", are already emerging, their first great songs, but overall the album on 4.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Good rock and roll music, but I never came close to appreciating this like I do their later work. That might be a tad shallow but it's how I feel.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is probably the Beatles’ first “real” album. This was the first step the band took from being a pop band to a rock band. Sure, most of the songs are about love, but that’s fine, because the songs are the wimpy kind of love songs (like “My Heart Will Go On”, for example). This album also has some of George Harrison’s most trippin’ guitar parts to date: “And I Love Her”, “A Hard Day’s Night”. This album often gets tossed aside and forgotten behind the band’s later albums. But it shouldn’t, because it’s just as good.<br><br>Favorite tracks: A Hard Day’s Night, I Should Have Known Better, If I Fell, I’m Happy Just to Dance With You, And I Love Her, Can’t Buy Me Love, Any Time At All</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">First half of this is essential. Really pleasant album, not complex like the later issues, just simple pop songs.<br><br>But they're great pop songs.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Il miglior album Beat che hanno fatto i Beatles, e probabilmente il miglior album Beat di sempre.<br>6,5 e tutti a casa.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A truly classic rock album by a truly classic rock band, ""A Hard Day's Night"" has five stone cold ""everybody know this song"" classics! They are ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""If I Fell"", ""And I Love Her"", and ""Can't Buy Me Love"". Beyond that there are outstanding tracks like ""Anytime At All"", ""Tell Me Why"", and the extra special ""Things We Said Today"". It's hard to review Beatles' albums like anyone else's albums because the songs are so imbedded into you that it's like you came out of the womb already knowing them. That being said, here are three more highlights of the album, ""I'll Cry Instead"", ""You Can't Do That"", and ""I'll Be Back"". There are no bad songs on this album, just some songs you like better than others.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">This is the album where the Beatles stood out as being great and showed their potential as songwriters. They abandoned doing cover songs and moved on to more complex and diverse material. It was still pretty typical British invasion style, but you can see the Beatles experimenting with different instruments, and were going for stronger melodies instead of throw away rock n roll songs. The lyrics have more interesting themes, which is what allowed the Beatles to stand out. This was their break through album in terms of what separated them from the other British invasion bands. <br><br>It has so many songs that have been cemented in rock history, with Hard Day's Night and its jangly rhythm that would influence the Byrds entire career, Can't Buy Me love which has a pretty cool beat behind it and a nice bluesy guitar solo, and of course there's the acoustic ballad, And I Love Her, that has a beautiful guitar riff and solo by George. It might be these three classic songs people remember but some of my favorites are actually the lesser talked about songs from the album like Things We Said Today which sounds like it was the basis for the Hollies song Bus Stop, and also has one of my favorite Beatles chord progressions. Tell Me Why is a pretty fun Motown influenced song that is pretty uplifting to hear after And I Love Her. If I Fell is another beautiful slow ballad. <br><br>The Second half of the album is actually a bit weak compared to the first, and some of the songs are quite forgettable. I'll Cry Instead is one of my least favorite Beatles songs and they are attempting country western style. When I Get Home is a catchy enough blues song but nothing more. You Can't Do That has a sort of catchy riff but doesn't really go anywhere. Then there's I'll Be Back which is a nice little closer, but I'll have to admit, it isn't one of the strongest closers of the Beatles, it has a nice melody but it doesn't stand out as much as I'd like it to. <br><br>But in terms of classic albums go, Hard Days Night really does deserve its reputation, its actually my favorite Beatles album from their early years and was a huge improvement over their previous two albums. It showed that by a little experimenting and writing their own songs, the Beatles could make some of the most interesting and unique music of their time, and started setting trends the other bands would follow.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Actually not bad, and I can tell that there songwriting skills are maturing. The film was very good and funny, and the album does not have as much as the tween music anymore.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles in their young, exciting, and yet musically dull period</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Very poppy Beatles album, but still very good. This is when the girls were screaming for the Beatles as seen in their movie of the same name, it is a great album even if it is not their best, it is the first important Beatles album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The reviewers here are correct.<br>A Hard Day's Night is the best early era Beatles album, and quite arguably the best of their entire catalog.<br>All original tunes.<br>The ballads are fantastic, heavy, and sung with complete confidence.<br>When the fab four decide to rock out, the vocals are gruff, pleading, and a screaming good time…complete with edgier guitar solos.<br>Another tight record that doesn't overindulge and gives you just what you need before checking out.<br>It's The Beatles.<br><br>9.2 A</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">They were getting better, but apart from a few songs like ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""And I Love Her"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" this is pretty much another generic 60s pop album.<br><br>The best thing about the album, though, is the fact that there are not covers so Lennon &amp; McCartney can start to showcase their talents.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles captured pop music perfection in the two and a half-minute song ""A Hard Day's Night"". This song exudes the excitement and joy of Beatlemania and is subsequently a perfect fit for the title of the movie. Its relentless movement, the constant pounding of percussion, the sly and sexual cadence of Lennon's lead vocal along with the dizzying heights that McCartney reaches during the song's bridge catapult this song as something more than a new pop song by the new fad pop group from England, this heralded quite clearly to all who could hear that there was indeed something more to this group, something of value, something solid and real.<br><br>The album flies by with one classic song after another. Though on side two the momentum does slow down quite a bit, the album is fantastic from start to finish. This album was also the first of their releases that was completely filled with original music. This was the album wherein people from around the world started to take note of the songwriting team of Lennon &amp; McCartney.<br><br>The weakest songs on the record are ""Any Time At All"" and ""When I Get Home"". And by weak I mean that they're just average. They could have been more than decent songs for other groups of the time, especially those in Britain about to make their big splash stateside, but because they were Beatles songs, they pale comparatively within their own collection. With ""Any Time At All"" the formula of ""A Hard Day's Night"" is at play with John taking the lead and Paul shadowing John's screaming vocal line. John also takes the lead on ""When I Get Home"", though there's an awful lot of harmonizing going on with the chorus, there's also a lot of awful harmonizing. It also features the often ridiculed lyric, ""I'm gonna love you 'til the cows come home"". John's razor like vocals almost save these two songs from being ordinary...almost, just not quite.<br><br>But there's so much here that is good, not just good, but great. There's the rhythmically jerky start to the album's closing song, the underrated ""I'll Be Back"" replete with its Buddy Hollyesque ""Ohahwaho"" vocals. There's the percussive country swing of ""I'll Cry Instead"", which by the way was not featured in the film originally, but was added to the film's re-release in the 1980's as an awkward primer before the beginning of the film.<br><br>The other two songs not to make it into the film were ""Things We Said Today"" and ""You Can't Do That"". In the case of ""You Can't Do That"", it was clipped out of the movie so that other songs could be played again briefly while making the end concert scene shorter. It's a pity it was cut, it would have fit into the movie rather nicely. The song seems tailor made to fit in with everything else that made it into the movie. The same point could be made for ""Things We Said Today"". Perhaps Richard Lester could have given Paul a scene to himself, like the one Ringo was able to get? In any case, the song shows Paul's growth as a writer and it finds both Paul and John harmonizing wonderfully together.<br><br>McCartney also gives his best lead vocal to date with ""Can't Buy Me Love"". Though the song wasn't new to movie goers at the time, its energy and drive rivals that of ""A Hard Day's Night"" and provides a balance of power to the lead vocal duties between Lennon and McCartney. And though ""Tell Me Why"" isn't on the same level as many of the great songs on the record, it was a song that caught the ear of Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys as a song to cover for an album of theirs only a year later.<br><br>With the exception of Ringo's inconsistent drum accents on the fills, most of what makes up ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You"" comes off as an innocent declaration of boyish charm, though it's probably just a polite laundry list of lies in disguise, but it is charmingly boyish all the same. And it provides a chance for George to take a lead vocal, though I think both Lennon and McCartney steal the show with their backing vocals, especially the ending ""Oh's"".<br><br>Lennon and McCartney also shine with their harmonies on ""If I Fell"". Even though the harmonies crack ever so on the last line of ""in vain"", all is well, the song features one of their strongest melodies to date and it is a rare treat to hear John's softer side. Certainly one of his better songs from this early era.<br><br>The album would not be complete if Paul didn't get a chance to perform as the romantic ballad man. Paul does get that chance, of course, with ""And I Love Her"". The song features wonderful acoustic lead guitar by George, with Paul double tracking his voice from time to time, the results are smooth and buttery. The Beatles were never ones to shy away from vocal double tracking, and this process is never more apparent then when it's featured on Lennon's ""I Should Have Known Better"". The beauty and fullness of the first line, the elongated ""I"" that Lennon sings sets the stage for what's to come. Lennon makes the hair on the back of the neck stand when he hits and holds the falsetto of the bridge, ""and when I ask you to be mi---ahah-hine"".<br><br>This really is a perfect recording of the Beatles during their most chaotic and explosive times in the spotlight. They more than lived up to the hype they helped to generate. They not only met the hype, they exceeded it immeasurably. This was their first perfect record. Yes...perfect. Not every song was perfect, but what was perfect, and there was a lot of it, more than made up for what was only average at best.<br><br>A lot of people at the time said this would be as far as they could go. I can't say I blame them for thinking that, but isn't the world a better place because this wasn't as far as they could go?<br><br>The first perfect pop record.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Lançado no auge da Beatlemania, em 1964, meses depois de os Beatles pousarem nos EUA e pararem o país com a lendária apresentação no programa de Ed Sullivan, A Hard Day’s Night mostra pela primeira vez a banda tomando corpo depois da absorção de influências e do conhecimento de terreno dos dois primeiros discos. Prova disto é que pela primeira vez a dupla Lennon/McCartney escreve todas as músicas.<br><br>Trilha do filme de mesmo nome, a faixa título reflete bem o sentimento inicial de incômodo com a fama monstruosa e inúmeros compromissos públicos (“It’s been a hard day’s night/And I’ve been working like a dog“). O acorde inicial de George, e John e Paul revezando os vocais, traz identidade para a banda abre o álbum com muita energia. “I Should Have Known Better”  é umas das mais memoráveis músicas da fase iê-iê-iê, carregada pela gaita de Lennon.<br><br>“If I Fell” e “And I Love Her”  são alguns dos motivos de eu estar aqui falando deles passados quase 50 anos. Com suas letras simples e melodias fáceis, passaram pelo teste do tempo com maestria e são duas das canções mais regravadas até hoje. São puramente músicas de amor, a primeira com a desconfiança de quem já sofreu (“If I fell in love with you/ would you promise to be true“), e a segunda alguém que se entregou perdidamente (“I give her all my love/That’s all I do“). Cafona ou não, o romantismo sempre vai estar presente na música pop, sendo apenas lapidado com as particularidades de cada época. Mas o sentimento é atemporal. Fechando o lado A, o hit “Can’t Buy Me Love”, que conta com uma ótima atuação de McCartney no baixo, lida novamente com o tema da recém-adquirida fama e fortuna.<br><br>O lado B é claramente inferior, aqui o destaque é “I’ll Be Back”, onde Lennon e McCartney cantam juntos. Repare perto da marca de dois minutos, a bateria e a voz de Paul somem completamente por um instante. Mostrando que por mais do que nós gostaríamos de acreditar, eles não eram perfeitos.</span>"

Asi nace su tercer disco A Hard Day`s Night, el mejor disco de su era rock and roll liderada por Lennon, sus canciones mas pesadas y mas rockeras se encuentran sin duda en este album (Solo en la version Britanica, la version de USA fue arruinada con instrumentales orquestados por George Martin), desde el impresionante acorde inicial del primer tema que fue hecho por Harrison en su Rickenbacker 360/12, el cual es reconocido e imitado en todo el mundo (Un ejemplo chileno es el acorde inicial de Maldito Sudaca de Los Prisioneros) hasta el cierre de I`ll Be Back es un disco lleno de rock y una balada emotiva hecha por McCartney como lo fue And I Love Her, el unico tema no tan decente es el cantado por Harrison, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You. Aun asi encontramos tambien grandes canciones como la movediza y pegadiza I Should Have Known Better, la reconocida cancion de Paul, Can`t Buy Me Love, los singles del lado B del lp original siguen la misma linea de la banda sonora de esta inusual pelicula, recomendados al cien por ciento.

"<span itemprop=""description"">In 1964 at the height of Beatlemania, the Beatles wrote and recorded two albums, starred in a movie, and toured the world? Fucking amazing! That the songwriting on this album is of such a consistently high standard is mind-boggling, and in my opinion rates it above Sgt Peppers, which if you think about it, had several dire tracks.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Este disco es un gran paso adelante para los Fab Four. Aquí ya no hay más covers, son todos originales Lennon-McCartney. Lennon fue el que más aportó, componiendo 10 canciones frente a las 3 de Paul. Se nota ya la superioridad de los originales  frente a los covers, y es por esto que, a comparación de sus dos primeros álbumes, este contiene mucho menos relleno.<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</strong>es el menos rockero de los primeros discos de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, ya que, salvo contadas excepciones, éstos son todos números pop bien típicos de los 60, cursis y empalagosos. La calidad de las composiciones es inmensa, y por lo tanto éstos son algunos de los mejores números pop cursis y empalagosos que jamás podrás escuchar. La experiencia vale la pena, como testimonio de la validez de la primera etapa de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong>, que a pesar de ser mucho más juvenil contiene grandes canciones.<br>La primera parte es la banda de sonido de la película del mismo nombre. Empieza con el que podría ser el mejor tema del disco, <strong class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</strong>. Ese comienzo tan característico, ese guitarrazo que te mete de lleno en el disco, es fantástico. Sin contar la, cuándo no, estupenda melodía, y la brillante aparición del cencerro en el estribillo. Un clásico de los Beatles tempranos. <br>Pero éste es sólo el comienzo. <strong class=""rymfmt"">I Should Have Known Better</strong> es un muy buen tema con una gran actuación de la armónica. <br>Una introducción algo oscura abre <strong class=""rymfmt"">If I Fell</strong>, una balada memorable de John, con unos coros y una melodía preciosas, es repetitiva pero no me molesta en absoluto con su grandeza melódica. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I'm Happy Just To Dance With You</strong> podría ser considerado relleno, pero es un buen relleno, un fresco rock and roll para bailar. <br>Retornamos a lo pop con un excelente bolero como <strong class=""rymfmt"">And I Love Her</strong>, candidato a la mejor canción del disco, compuesta por Paul. La performance vocal de Paul es simplemente brillante, y la canción ostenta una gran belleza, una composición acústica muy buena y madura para lo que era la banda en ese momento.<br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Tell Me Why</strong> viene a interrumpir esta gran seguidilla, candidata a la peor canción de la historia de Los Beatles, es muy ruidosa y repetitiva, y tiene una letra miserable. <br>Pero bueno, todo se redime con <strong class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</strong>, el otro clásico de este CD, con ese estribillo instantáneamente memorable. Un poco sobrevalorada para mí, pero es otro highlight del CD. <br>La segunda parte baja de calidad, pero sigue siendo buena. <strong class=""rymfmt"">Any Time At All</strong> es una canción mediocre, sin lugar a dudas relleno, aunque igualmente la disfruto a veces. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">I'll Cry Instead</strong> es, como decirlo, una canción curiosa, con unos arreglos de guitarra extraños, muy divertida.  Un riff rápido maravilloso abre <strong class=""rymfmt"">Things We Said Today</strong>, una gran canción con una melodía tristona. <br><strong class=""rymfmt"">When I Get Home</strong> es, para muchos, la peor canción del disco. Para mí es un relleno agradable pero sin valor alguno, que igualmente es mejor que Tell Me Why. <strong class=""rymfmt"">You Can't Do That</strong> es una buena cancón, donde destacan sobre todo el riff, los contracoros y el puente del medio. <br>Para terminar, una gran balada como <strong class=""rymfmt"">I'll Be Back</strong>, con arreglos hermosos de guitarra y una melodía melancólica muy efectiva. <br>Y así concluye probablemente el mejor disco de los <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> tempranos. Un 8-<br>Mejor canción: A Hard Day's Night<br>Highlights: A Hard Day's Night, If I Fell, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love, Things We Said Today, I'll Be Back<br>Lowlights: Tell Me Why</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles' first great album and the epitome of the entire Beatlemania aesthetic - the enduring public image of the pre-Rubber Soul fab four neatly encapsulated in just over half an hour. The Beatles as four interchangeable characters - a product - their distinct personalities largely buried deep beneath the surface, producing bright, shiny pop for mass consumption, available in both film and musical form. If that seems oddly depressing, let's step back and not overthink things; this is the best collection of material in the Beatles career thus far, a marked improvement on their first two LPs on just about every level. Instrumentally, things get much more interesting with the addition of George Harrison's 12-string guitar (that opening chord!), a little less harmonica, a lot more cowbell and various other little dynamics and experiments that they hadn't really done much of on the previous two records (the way ""Any Time at All"" fires off like a canon as Ringo slams his drums, for instance). Lyrically, the Beatles' arsenal still consists exclusively of love songs, but their emotional range and the relationship dynamics they cover is almost certainly equal to anything else in rock at this time. Taken together, this is the first truly essential Beatles LP, and the only one from their earlier period; a cultural touchstone and a textbook for pop/rock songwriting. It was a major improvement on their first two efforts as a band, and with thirteen original songs, it was simultaneously a big step forward in the development of rock music as a whole.<br><br>Highlights: ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""Any Time at All""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Lots of John on this one. Great stuff.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is probably my least favorite Beatles album for some reason. It's certainly not bad at all, but it just seems to pale in comparison to some of their other feats. I think it was with this album that they became millionaires, which is pretty amazing back in 1964 and it being one of their early albums. The songs I like best on here are ""I'm happy just to dance with you"", ""Any time at all"" and ""When I get home"". It's a good album, but not my favorite Beatles release.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles Hard days night is for some reason my favorite Beatles album. I don't necessarily think its the best musically. I just love the way it starts out and each song is perfectly arranged.  If I haven't listened to the Beatles in awhile, this is usually the first album I turn to.  So many classics on this one.  I don't rate it perfect because the second half of the album is not as good for me.  I do enjoy ALL the songs.  Its just a few on the second part are less then perfect to me.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A powerhouse of an album, famously the only one to comprise solely Lennon &amp; McCartney songs. That said, the song count is Lennon 9 McCartney 3 (I can't tell who wrote George's vocal number), but both are on top form and besides it just feels like a band album - the complaining about who had too many songs would come later.<br>No album could have had a more exhilararting start than that tumultuous piano/guitar chord which announces the headlong title track and it barely lets up until the final lush fade on closing track ""I'll Be Back"".<br>My favourites include the sunny harmonica-led ""I Should Have Known Better"", McCartney's old-before-his-time ""Things We Said Today"", the bitter-sweet ""If I Fell"" and the swaggering ""I Call Your Name"".<br>It's barely 28 minutes long from start to finish but there's nary a note wasted. Way to follow through on ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"", boys!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">""And I love her"" is perfectly beautiful pop music, a timeless song. The rest is Beatles. I have never really liked them, probably never will.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description""><em>A Hard Day's Night </em>was the soundtrack album for their first movie. It's also the first Beatle record to contain 100% original material. <br>The movie is shot in a documentary style, and is supposed to be a light hearted chronicle of their daily lives. The soundtrack reflects just that. It's light and fun.<br>Side A of the record features the 7 tracks which appeared in the film. <br>Stand out tracks include:<br>The title track, ""A Hard Day's Night,"" which was actually one of the last tracks written for the film. It's probably most known for the powerful chord struck at the beginning of the song. There's a way to launch into an album. It instantly initiates the power of the song.<br>""Can't Buy Me Love"" which is a McCartney rocker, based on a 12 bar blues.<br>""If I Fell,"" which features John and Paul harmonizing beautifully over this ballad.<br>""You Can't Do That,"" another rocker track which features a rare John Lennon guitar solo.<br>This marks the first time that the Beatles would substantially influence popular music with something never done before. For many of the tracks on this record, George Harrison broke out a new wepon: The Rickenbacker electric 12 string. <br>Used on at least 7 of the 12 tracks, its chiming, chrystal-like sound is the perfect accent to this album. <br>You know the opening chord to the title track? How about the electric guitar during the bridge and solo in ""I Should Have Known Better?"" That's the 12 string. As the owner of one of these beautiful instruments, I may be speaking with a bias, but Harrison was way ahead of his time with the use of this instrument. In my opinion, the Rickenbacker adds a new twist to music when played on the right song, to this day. We're pushing 50 years, folks.<br><em> A Hard Day's Night </em>was the album that made every young adult want to start a band. <br>It's fun and it's worth a listen.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first Beatles album to be full of all Lennon/McCartney originals. Despite this partnership I would almost like to think of this record as Lennon's solo debut, although there is a tremendous McCartney presence. In the end, Lennon sang lead on 9 of 13 songs here. Lennon is my favorite Beatle so it's great to see he him shining here as leader.<br><br>My favorite tracks: ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""If I Fell"", ""I'll Be Back"", ""You Can't Do That"", ""And I Love Her""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Less than 5 stars is just a fiasco...<br>Superb rock n roll music from the fabulous four!!!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">La première face constitue la bande originale du film du même nom qui vient célébrer avec humour la beatlemania.

Very original, catchy and young.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A huge goddamned moment in rock music. If you read my review for the mediocre let down that With The Beatles you'd know I had tough words for the Beatles, a strong desire to see and hear them change that shit up. And unless you live under a rock you should know they fixed on that, but maybe you didn't know exactly where. Well how about the very next release and album? And in 64' no less? It's hard to appreciate this nowadays when it's absolutely the norm so much that it feels like a law of nature....but albums back then used to be drenched in covers. You'd have people like The Beatles and Kinks who had a fair level of originals but at least 50% covers, and then people like The Searchers who had practically one original on their albums and stuffed the rest with covers. It's easier to appreciate what A Hard Day's Night did if you've sat through some of those records, With The Beatles itself being a great example. Because when you sit down with A Hard Day's Night? You sittin' down with ALL ORIGINAL baby. Yeah! That is what I am talking about! And it's not some short quickie either, it's no shorter than the last two. By the standards of the time this was a piece of hard work and no less. Who would do such a thing? It's gotta be said that I don't think The Beatles were simply better than others by some innate talent. I think it was hard work factors that made them what they were. They did extensive performance time in rough clubs in West Germany that really honed them in the first place, but the thing that charges this sort of worth ethic even after major success? One word: Rivalry. Some band's get ruined by clashing egos in the band, either because it breaks them up or specifically in the case of Dinosaur Jr because it becomes a one sided dictatorship. The Beatles thankfully never truly became one sided, sure Paul usually had the power, but he never sat on it comfortably. John was always challenging him and playing the rebel. The two of them competing bitterly and occasionally happily? THAT'S the fire on their massively powerful songwriting furnace. And that explains this achievement. But this would be what if it had only so-so songs? Historical and nothing more. The songwriting quality more than justifies the turn into originals with lots of goodies, so much that it brings into question how they dropped the ball on the previous album so much? There's the well known classics everyone likes here like Can't Buy Me Love and the title track, but also undersung gems like Any Time At All! Nothing even really feels like filler either, which could not be said before. That too is amazing, in fact maybe more amazing! Make a full original album, great you wouldn't have to do more. But to make each song feel labored on? That's some other shit already. Their first great album, an important building block to where mastery came into the picture. Oh, and I hear the movies a blast too. God, why do these dudes have to be good at everything they touched? Stop it!<br><br>Ratings: 4<br>Highlights: A Hard Day's Night, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love, Any Time At All</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Dopo due album di rodaggio, si inizia a fare sul serio.

Trying to bridge the awkward gap between naive youth and young maturity is not an easy task for anyone from any walk of life, however few have made that transition in the withering public gaze. <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> did it, not only that, but they did it as film cameras rolled as they made their first cinematic feature film. <br><br>While <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> may be <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> best film offering, the accompanying album is less successful It spends most of its time trying to successfully navigate their way from maturity from youthful exuberance, which as we all know, is something of an impossible task. While a capable collection of catchy tunes, it falls short as a genuinely satisfying album by the best beat group on the planet, with both sides of the original album being overshadowed by the title track on the first side and the still true to this day ""Can't Buy Me Love"" on the second. As both sides of the album were dominated by these evergreen classics, it is no wonder that this album is rather uneven.<br><br>If (like me) you are slowly but surely collecting each and every album by <strong class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</strong> as and when I see them at a sensible price, then <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is obviously a must-buy. If you're a fan of their early pop material, then it is certainly one of the albums you'll want to pick up eventually. However, if you're a fair-weather fan, then there are certainly better albums out there more worthy of your hard earned cash.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">""If there's something I have said or done,<br>Tell me what and I'll apologise.""</em></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Quite simply the greatest pop album ever made, bar none.<br><br>I'll never fathom people who write this off as ""silly."" There could really be no more asinine an opinion. There is nothing silly about this music. It's genius on many levels.<br><br>If you are a songwriter and you have not studied this album to the point of obsession, you may as well give up your career immediately. That's just my opinion though.<br><br>Currently this is my favorite Beatles album.<br><br>When I first found out about them as a kid, it was Revolver for ""Tomorrow Never Knows.""<br><br>I got a bit older and did even more drugs, and then it was The White Album.<br><br>Then it was Rubber Soul, for a very long time. Rubber Soul may still be my favorite.<br><br>That said, A Hard Day's Night is the culmination of their early work as a singles band, and essentially the album version of such stuff as ""From Me to You."" Frankly, as time goes on I find myself enthralled, deeply, by their early singles surrounding this album, such as ""Love Me Do.""<br><br>On this album, some of the sleepers are ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Things We Said Today,"" which are some of the best songs the group ever made. I increasingly find myself preferring this work to their older music for whatever reason.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Ścieżka dźwiękowa do pierwszego filmu z udziałem Beatlesów, pod tym samym tytułem. Oczywiście mamy tu bardzo dobry zestaw utworów rozpoczynający się od tytułowego poprzez ""I Should Have Known Better"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"" cudownej ballady „And I Love Her” oraz kilku innych utworów. Zarówno album i film ukazały się w szczytowym okresie popularności Beatlesów, nie tylko w Europie, ale również USA, co pozwoliło otworzyć drogę dla wielu innych zespołów grających podobną muzykę.<br><br>The soundtrack to the first film with the Beatles, with the same title. Of course, we have a very good set of songs that begins with the title through ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""Can not Buy Me Love,"" a wonderful ballad ""And I Love Her"" and a few other tracks. Both the album and the film appeared at the peak of the popularity The Beatles, not only in Europe but in the U.S. too, what helped open the way for many other bands playing similar music.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I grew up listening to nearly all the Beatles albums although I was too young to appreciate their importance at the time. I took them for granted to the point that later, even though I perceived them to be rather old-fashioned for my progressive (rock) tastes, I never openly questioned their relevance. In the case of their later albums this only goes to show how ahead of their time they were, not that I really differentiated between the early and late stuff, they were simply a part of the furniture.<br>The songs as I perceive them:<br>A Hard Days Night, with its busy rhythm section, takes off from its famous opening chord like a greyhound. Lennon's melody works surprisingly well, the middle bit is probably McCartney and is cleverer but still only a foil for the verses.<br>I Should've Known Better has the same tempo and is so simple that it cannot fail to work, even the mouth organ part is as catchy as hell!<br>If I Fell is sublime and John and Paul never sounded better when harmonizing, than on this beautifully innocent mid-tempo ballad set off by its heartfelt intro. The instrumentation is more open than on the previous two numbers and Ringo only visits his snares three times throughout the whole song.<br>I'm Happy Just To Dance With You has a Bo Diddley like rhythm behind it. Perhaps it was suggested that George take the lead on at least one of the tracks, his voice was always rather flat but there is enough melody here to keep it buoyed up.<br>And I Love Her is one of a number of light-weight ballads McCartney wrote for the Beatles, this one has a poignancy that prevents it being too sweet. You can so easily imagine Lennon on steel acoustic, Harrison on Spanish, McCartney on bass and Ringo on bongos, it all works so well!<br>Tell Me Why is downbeat rhythm and blues and McCartney can't resist walking the bass. Lennon's voice distorts and breaks and i'll bet he just loved to sing it and hear it played back, the middle bit, though, ends on a comical falsetto...I wonder if McCartney ever attempted a more serious delivery?<br>Can't Buy Me Love also lends itself to a walking bass but McCartney resists this time. A wash of cymbals and a strong back-beat with stops, just before the punch-line, showcase this crafted arrangement. A great guitar break is the icing on the cake.<br>Anytime At All is based on a strong circular chord sequence and has another strategically placed stop, emphasized this time by a great whack from Ringo. McCartney helps out when the chorus is too high for Lennon and during the verses the lines follow so closely they must have been done separately.<br>I'll Cry Instead is a fast country blues and very short, probably because nothing could be found to break it up and it simply dídn't bear repetition, but that's ok because the middle bits do the job anyway.<br>Things We Said Today does repeat itself perhaps one too many times but it's such an ingenious song, with its alternating minor and major themes, that each succeeding part injects new life into it.<br>When I Get Home is raucous and Lennon is impatient to get home (!) so it's best not to stand in his way. The chords seem a little forced but Lennon can blag his way through that, no problem.<br>You Can't Do That is much better even though Lennon is still angry. Ringo can't leave his cowbell alone on this terrific rocker. In the middle break the backing vocals and a jangling guitar jostle for position, it's electrifying!<br>The choruses are great too and there is some nifty bass playing from McCartney, if you listen carefully.<br>I'll Be Back is Lennon being sensitive and reverting somewhat to his Buddy Holly vocal style rather than the throat-ripping delivery of the last two numbers. The major/minor stuff may have been influenced by McCartney's earlier song and works just as well. Ringo is almost dispensable and Harrison is on a tea-break.<br>There is nothing experimental on A Hard Days Night, that would all come later, these are fantastic songs performed brilliantly and superbly recorded in mono.<br>Certainly the best of the early Beatles if not of all their work</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I'm fond of the first half of The Beatles career, albeit not as much as their later work. If I ever reach for an early Beatles album, its usually either this or <a title=""[Album207]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/help-2/"" class=""album"">Help!</a>. Here, they have the beginnings of a sound maturing into their own, though there is still quite a bit of sweetness to go around.<br><br>If I it were between this and ""Help!,"" I would choose the latter. Scratch that, if it were just comparing first sides, this would definitely win. Some of my favorite songs of their career are here, such as ""And I love Her"" and ""If I Fell."" As iconic as the title track is, these two tracks are my go-to favorites.<br><br>The issues is the second half of the album, however. While there are no bad songs on this side, unlike the b-side of ""Help!,"" which unfortunately has ""Dizzy Miss Lizzy,"" It all feels underwhelming when up against the first half.<br><br>I would begrudgingly pick the preceding album by a hair if push came to shove, just for it's more well-rounded, diverse sound. However, not many albums have this amount of standouts packed next to each other.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A Hard Days Night (Rare 1965 UK 2nd Pressing of the 1964 13-track stereo LP on the black &amp; yellow Parlophone label. Complete with original EMI advert inner. A superb near 'as new' example of a forty year old album! PCS3058).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The 1st beatles classic album of their career , and certainly the best of their early work.<br><br> The Lennon/mccartney partnership was at its peak here , at the height of beatlemania with the band hitting new levels of fame on both sides of the atlantic . Afterwards the 2 men went their own way a bit in terms of their writing . Certainly i dont think lennon sang any better than he did on ""a hard days night"" .<br><br>The songs from the film are all brilliant , the title track ,""and i love her"" and ""cant buy me love"" show the groups music and arrangements getting more sophisticated and georges 12 string rickenbacker adds a new dimension to their sound . The film itself was simply a window into the world of the group and suceeded brilliantly at associating the groups fans with the individual members more closely . It was a smart move and the beatles matched it by composing a perfect spectrum of their talents to showcase.<br><br>But the other half of the record is hardly filler , the unison harmonies powering the catchy  ""tell me why"" , the nagging country strum of ""ill cry instead"" , the haunting melancholy of ""ill be back"" and the underrated ""things we said today"" or the sheer razor sharp toughness that lennon imbues ""you cant do that"" and ""any time at all"" which are all fantastic moments in the bands career . The record works as a whole .<br><br>This was the 1st beatles album i heard ,from my mums old vinyl and ive always had a strong attatchment to it and i always will . Its sheer pop music genius .<br><br><br>The remastering is brilliant here - great seperation of tracks and clarity of sound .

The restr ain't too shabby neither, but I dig the movie a whole bunch better than the album, as a whole. Much like, magical Mystary tour.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Some cosmic intuition led me to purchase the remastered CD version of this album exactly 46 years after its original release. And I swear, I still didn't know it in the record store.<br><br>What does the album sound like, then? Great, of course. Now and then it features similar remastering innovations to <em class=""rymfmt"">Beatles for Sale,</em> but even when it doesn't, I like it (possibly excluding ""You Can't Do That"" which still contains irritating lyrics, remastered or not). Anyway, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is an evident example of an album that caused a mania and still raises some kind of fever in me as a listener (or is it the temperature? 28°C outside and at least the same inside, no matter what you do). And as this is about The Beatles, you can be sure that some of the mania is <strong class=""rymfmt"">still</strong> there.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">With the exception of ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""Hard Day's Night"" this is pretty average.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Ah pop music, a style of music that in modern times leaves me nothing but shuddering at the marketing crap and machinations that went into turning the masses into fans of a crappy recylced artist like Lady Gaga, or the auto-tuned stylings and heavy dance/repetitive beats of Black Eyed Peas, or the teeny bopping hearthrob little substance of the Biebers, or the crap artist that won American Idol but ain't attractive and musically ain't memorable but has the pop sheen songwriting talents by her side and that original idol winning persona, of Kelly Clarskon, etc....<br><br>But go back....way back....when Rock was first starting, and Rock and Pop were rather interchangeable.  Elvis might be thought of as the king of Rock, but for his day he was nothing more than Pop.  Buddy Holly?  Rockabilly yes, but Pop first, Girl Groups, Spector, etc...pop, pop, pop.  Even the early Stones, widely viewed as one of the ""tougher"" rock bands--love that marketing--were a pop wannabe....<br><br>So were the Beatles....the safe, conforming, very conservative (or so the marketers wanted the masses to think) Beatles--who despite it all were probably more left than the Stones, but it took a while for John, and Paul to break the mold and show their true side....<br><br>And judging from the songs, sure they do seem mostly safe....<br><br>I mean sure When I Get Home might hint at some affairs...but it's very minor, and the rest is just feel good, have fun pop.....<br><br>And yet it's hardly a bad thing.  The Beatles were pop songwriters, first, second and third.  As much rock as they had (and they had it in droves with a great rhythm section of Paul/Ringo, a solid lead guitarist, and one of rock's best singers in John), the songwriting team of John and Paul were just too talented to not write hook ridden, complex harmonies and songs....<br><br>And rarely has that pop formula been more on display than on the entirety of AHDN, the only time the Beatles ever released an album entirely written by John and Paul....<br><br>And it's simply stunning.  There ain't a single bad track on this, and the array of pop styles is stunning, indicating the greatness that would continue.  This was Lennon's band still and it shows....he was still doing his pop thing, and at that game few can top him (but he wanted to be an artist/different, so later in his career he kind of tried--to move away from his natural hook ridden pop style and move into rock......something he was also very capable of .<br><br>It's a bit pointless to really highlight a track or two, as both the song by song rating will show, and a cursory look at this album will show, it's brilliant from start to finish.  <br><br>This is one of the very best albums ever made, and yet because it's ""pop""it's often forgotten just how great this one is compared to not only the competition of the time, but to the very best the Beatles would ever put together on record.  A masterpiece.<br><br>One last thing, the Stereo remaster highlights a mistake on If I Fell where Paul's high note cracks and is missed, whcih is very frustrating, especially because that's one of the best tunes on this release, and now the great remaster (MONO) is only available to the committed fans like me who bought that expensive, but totally worth it--mono boxed set, and this stereo version will be the likely version younger folks'll hear, and thus If I Fell might not have the proper punch it truly deserves.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Possibly the first power pop album ever<br>When you're used to the later Beatles, this record sounds dirty, and it rocks like hell.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Out of their first four albums, this is easily the most consistent.  It's a near perfect pop album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In the William Hartnell Doctor Who story ""The Chase"", companion Vicki, a girl from the far future, hears The Beatles for the first time, and comments that she ""didn't know they played classical music.""<br><br>At the time of Beatlemania in 1964, the Beatles-lovers were offset by the Beatles-haters, who heard nothing but an appalling noise from these uncouth Englishmen, and it's not really surprising, since their music was so new, so in-your-face at the time.  Of course, if they knew what was to come in the decades following, most would probably agree with Vicki - compared with so much of that, The Beatles sound like classical music!<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night </em>is the band's third album, the first to feature all original compositions (only Lennon/McCartney ones, which is a bit odd; this would have been a great opportunity for a Harrison or two), the first seven of which feature in the rip-roaring film of the same name, and there's no doubt it's their best to date.<br><br>While the title song, with its famous opening chord, kicks well, it's the next two songs that are the initial winners for me - ""I Should Have Known Better"" remains one of my favourite Beatles songs of all - it's just a perfect example of smooth, streamlined pop - while ""If I Fell"" is stunning, with breathtaking vocal harmonies from John and Paul that one would find hard to match in any musical recording since.<br><br>From there, I could pick out any other song and say something nice about it, except possibly ""Can't Buy Me Love"".  Maybe it's because of its over exposure, but I've often found the song abrasive to the point where it's more annoying than catchy, and yet it captures the mood and tone of The Beatles at that time perfectly.  I do particularly like the dirty rock of ""When I Get Home"" (I love that 'wooaah wooahh aaahhh"" bit), while Paul's ""Things We Said Today"" is another grabbing tune that was just unlike anything else at the time, while the concluding ""I'll Be Back"" echoes ""If I Fell"" with its harmonies and deft melody.  It's a very fitting finale.<br><br>No, I don't hate ""Can't Buy Me Love"". I just struggle with it at times.  <br>Really, it goes well with an album of remarkably consistent, melodious, tightly played numbers (only offset by the still very juvenile and corny, puppy love lyrics) that put the record in its deserved place as one of the classics of the sixties.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Other than Bob Dylan, 'pop' artists in 1964 didn't write most or often even much of their own album material-so it's especially noteworthy that<em> A Hard Day's Night </em>features only Lennon/McCartney penned numbers.  This is an almost uniformly strong album, weakest track is probably ""I Should Have Known Better"", and it's still infinitely hummable.  McCartney contributes three great tracks, but this album probably marks Lennon's high point as the dominant Beatle.  9.1/10</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Did they really record this whole thing in a day?  Damn.<br><br>On my iTunes:<br>""A Hard Day's Night""<br>""I Should Have Known Better""<br>""If I Fell""<br>""And I Love Her""<br>""Can't Buy Me Love""<br>""Any Time At All""<br>""Things We Said Today""<br>""I'll Be Back""</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">One of their greatest albums and it even came with an awesome movie. Everyone knows the famous chord, played by Harrison, that opens the song. It's probably the most well known song on the album, if not the most well known Beatles song. But, in my opinion, there are better songs on this record. One of my favorite all time songs is ""If I Fell"". With its unusual structure and the two-part harmony with McCartney &amp; Lennon. Defiantly, by this album if you don't already have it. <br><br>Favorites<br>- If I Fell<br>- And I Love Her<br>- Can't By Me Love<br>- I'll Cry Instead<br>- A Hard Day's Night<br>- Tell My Why<br>- I Should Have Known Better<br>- Any Time At All</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">One of my ""personal"" favourite Beatles albums. It's not five stars because it's not got the influential weight of their later output, and there's a weak song or two. But it's the ultimate moptop album; harmonies are at their best, and with songs as rocking as the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"", and as beautiful as ""If I Fell"" and ""And I Love Her"", I can keep coming back to it. Plus it's the first album of Lennon-McCartney originals. And listen to the tone on that Rickenbacker!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">There is not a single misstep on this damn near perfect pop album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles first masterpiece</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><strong class=""rymfmt""><em class=""rymfmt"">Love Has Been Already Bought</em></strong><br>By the time <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> was released there was no need for the <strong class=""rymfmt"">Beatles</strong> to buy any love – they were everybody’s darlings and nobody’s fools already and the big order of the day. Counting out somewhat vulgar rhyme dog/log this album sounds almost perfect to me.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><strong class=""rymfmt""><a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://rateyourmusic.com/list/Guidoble/1001_albums__the_1960s_"" target=""_blank"">1001 Albums: The 1960s</a></strong><br><br>Opening with perhaps the most famous chord in music, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is a wonderful record and soundtrack to their eponymous film. John Lennon steals the show with having lead vocals on half of the tracks.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I should make my five star rating clear right away. Having grown up listening to all of the songs, yes I do mean ALL OF THE SONGS on this album throughout my formative years, those young and impressionable years, I have grown to love the melodramatic instrumental versions as classic tunes in their own right. I realize that the inclusion of these muzak cover versions over the actual original Lennon and McCartney songs is what makes this record as a non-essential album. It makes no difference, I love them.<br><br>And seeing that there isn't any real reason to go into the actual Beatles recordings for this album, I can save that for the UK release, I will concentrate on the instrumental versions for this release.<br><br>One quick side note: the album lists the track ""I'll Cry Instead"" as ""I Cry Instead"". Also the back cover has fifteen cubes of Beatle head shots; three of John, three of Ringo, four of Paul and five of George. And of those fifteen shots, only John and George have one of the same pictures used on the UK version. How's that for useless trivia?<br><br>Now, back to the instrumental muzak.<br><br>The weakest entry of the four instrumentals is the one that gets to be heard first on side one, the screwy up tempo ""I Should Have Known Better"". The song alternates between the Hank Marvinesque guitar leadings for the beginning lyrics and then to the horn and sax heavy leads of the following lyrics. All the while taking turns for each lyric lead, the drummer is the only one that holds back until he's given free range to shoot in a machine gun inspired fill. Not bad, just the weakest of what is to come.<br><br>Side one closes with the instrumental version of ""And I Love Her"". It should be noted that both instrumentals on side one are heard before the Beatles versions get to be heard on side two. Anyway, ""And I Love Her"" features a syrupy string arrangement for its main lyric lines while a steady conga beat moves the song along. Every now and again there's a piano flourish and an acoustic guitar, which is a carbon copy of the original. The trumpet section gets to take the ""bright are the stars"" part, which then leads back into more strings for the remaining lines before the solo, wherein the acoustic takes the solo. There's a beautiful flute that gets to take a couple of lines before the strings sweep it up to the last line. The song ends a bit awkwardly with the same piano flourish that was heard echoing throughout the song.<br><br>Then we come to ""Ringo's Theme(This Boy)"", the best remembered and most prominently placed instrumental song from the movie. The song has a nice shuffling beat, a comfortable meshing of horns and strings and electric guitar and it captures more steadily, perhaps more so by what this version is not, an innocent wistfulness that is not so apparent in the original version. Love this version.<br><br>Though not exactly the way you'd want to end a typical Beatles record, the instrumental version of ""A Hard Day's Night"" is how this non-typical Beatles album ends. The song squeaks by on a goofy charm, perhaps because of its use in the movie, perhaps because the jazzy swinging version seems so antithetical to what the Beatles were at the time, what they meant to their fans, who knows? In any case, I've grown to love it. I can't say the same thing about the instrumental music from the film ""Help!"", so I think there is something to these instrumentals, they do have a charm about them.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first album to contain all original songs.In terms of invention and musicality this is a huge quatum leap from their first two albums.The minute you hear the Gminor sus4 chord at the start you just know this is going to be special.</span>"

However more-so than silver screen fame, was the fact The Beatles had composed an album of entirely unique material. The standards for English rock bands in the early sixties was to cover traditional songs or <a title=""[Genre131]"" class=""genre"" href=""/genre/Blues/"">Blues</a>/<a title=""[Genre231]"" class=""genre"" href=""/genre/Rhythm+%26+Blues/"">Rhythm &amp; Blues</a> songs that had been penned by either someone famous or someone American. Most times both. However here The Beatles penned all their own material, and other contemporary artists such as <a title=""[Artist45]"" href=""/artist/the_rolling_stones"" class=""artist"">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a title=""[Artist946]"" href=""/artist/the-kinks"" class=""artist"">The Kinks</a>, <a title=""[Artist1926]"" href=""/artist/the_hollies"" class=""artist"">The Hollies</a> etc. would soon follow suit. <br><br>The album kicks off with the memorable opening chord slashing out of the silence to kick off what was the biggest moment in the Beatles early period. Ringo's percussion is on the ticket as George's 12 string guitar drives the song to an all time artistic peak for the young Beatles. This artistic peak is only complimented by the bluesy harmonica solo that greats our fascinated ears as Lennon rolls the notes of the harmonica before bursting into song. The content of the song showcases not only Lennon's development as an artist, tackling the harmonica, acoustic rhythm guitar and vocals, but also portrays Lennon's growing admiration for <a title=""[Artist22]"" href=""/artist/bob-dylan-1"" class=""artist"">Bob Dylan</a>, who was ""great lyrically"" and transforming into a key role model for Lennon. The song just also happens to be one of my uncles favourite songs. The ballads of the album, ""If I Fell"" (Lennon's) and ""And I Love Her"" (McCartney), became instant ballad standards in the music world, rearing their heart-felt chords in posh clubs to down town pubs. The Beatles also employed swing and groove into their music, injecting ""Tell Me Why"" with the former and ""You Can't Do that"" with the latter. Notably ""You Can't Do That"" has Lennon's rhythm section leading the way, complete with cowbell and bongos to drive the song through it's groovy peaks. I remember listening to the late night BBC1 Radio Show (the name of the show escapes me) up in Manchester, and on the tail end of songs like ""Wild Young Hearts"" by <a title=""[Artist57508]"" href=""/artist/noisettes"" class=""artist"">Noisettes</a>, ""Pull Shapes"" by <a title=""[Artist63772]"" href=""/artist/the_pipettes"" class=""artist"">The Pipettes</a> etc. it was quite interesting to hear the show close with ""I'll Be back"" by The Beatles, penning the famous term way before Cameron and Schwarzenegger got their hands on it. This darker more acoustic number sounds like Lennon settling a long ongoing score in some troubled relationship. Especially when they hit the low notes, you feel it. Brilliant closer.<br><br>Lennon continued grafting his steps into the position of head Beatle, dominating the vocal duties with ten of the thirteen tracks, while Lennon started to experiment with different signature time plays, something that would characterize The Beatles most famous future works. Despite all this, McCartney still managed to produce the most successful single off the record, his ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ruling the roost for three weeks in the UK, and five weeks in the U.S.A. This poppy tune features one of the rare instances where a 12-bar blues verse was incorporated by The Beatles in their original material. ""When I Get Home"" may have musical been an inspiration for the intro to ""Keep on Running"" by <a title=""[Artist6082]"" href=""/artist/the_spencer_davis_group"" class=""artist"">The Spencer Davis Group</a>, while the riff in ""Tell My Why"" was sampled to death and beyond in <a title=""[Artist2634]"" href=""/artist/the-residents"" class=""artist"">The Residents</a> ""Beyond the Valley of a Day in the Life"". <br><br>No matter how you spin the record though, there's no denying how influential this record was on British music, yet alone music on the whole, as well as The Beatles truly finding the mastery within to create some of the most distinctive and memorable music ever. It was years ahead of its time to say at the least. To bad The Beatles backtracked slightly for the next record...<br> <br>7.5/10</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">By ditching the cover versions and raising their songwriting standards, The Beatles did a great third album. ""A Hard Day's Night"" also works weel as the soundtrack to the movie of the same name, to boot.<br><br>The singles, as usual, are simply delicious. ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""And I Love Her"" are all great tracks, and better than the singles from the previous two albums. But the impressive thing about ""A Hard Day's Night"" is that it's the first album by the Beatles to have album tracks that are even better than the singles; ""I'll Cry Instead"", ""Tell Me Why"", ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" and ""I Should Have Known Better"" are as good as 60s pop gets.<br><br>We can't see that the Beatles would become the most influential band ever on ""A Hard Day's Night"" yet, despite all the commercial success. But this album at least cemented them as an stellar pop act.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">My favourite of the early beatles albums.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">MusicGourmets Listening Club: Week 37<br><br>Nearly every song on this album is classic. Even the ones that aren't are very good. My parents have been big Beatles fans since they came out, so I grew up listening to the Beatles, which played a big part in starting my love of music. So in a way, this reminds me of my childhood, and not the bad parts of my childhood, either. Just the good parts.<br><br>4.5 Rating.<br><br><a class=""normal_link"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" href=""http://www.musicgourmets.com/forum/index.php"" target=""_blank"">MusicGourmets.com</a></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Most people will divide The Beatles’ catalog in two. The first division characterized by the so called Beatlemania, with poppy top charting hits, and the second division, the more elaborate, psychedelic version of the Fab Four. Musically, the latter might be the best, featuring gems like Revolver or what else than Sgt Peppers and the Lonely Hearts Club Band, but even though the latest albums are close to perfection, their earlier work did have many highlights, and my favorite must definitely be “A Hard Day’s Night”.<br><br> Where “Meet the Beatles” and “With the Beatles” featured way too much filler and forgettable content, this album proves their can be an album worth of early Beatles material. Of special quality are the first 3 songs, which begin with that unnameable note on Hard Day’s Night, followed by my album favorite “I Should’ve Known Better”, and the love ballad “If I Fell”. In quality, the rest of the songs are not far away from these three openers, all running around two and fraction minutes, the Beatles sing a mixture of upbeat and more conventional love ballads.<br><br> Even though I have just watched the movie once, I felt it had aged pretty badly, but fortunately, I can’t say the same with this majestic soundtrack. Even though I’ve never dared to rank The Beatles catalog, “A Hard Day’s Night” is a strong contender for the top position.<br><br>Review Update: When reviewing this album, I probably was too excited about the ""Go Review That Album Game"" (this was my first post), that I rated 5 stars an album which is fun and wnjoyable, but this can't be the only basus for rating a record.<br><br>Now that I'm listening to records on vinyl, I found out this album didn't sound as good, specially on side B, which I feel falls short to the first side. (You can't notice this on CD releases).</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I've always had issues with those early Beatles records. Everything sounds made for Broadway to me for the most part. Basically the Beatles before Bob Dylan got them high is nothing more than a singles band. A Creedence Clearwater Revival if you will. But what great singles bands they were. <br><br>The title track, 'I Should Have Known Better' 'And I Love Her' 'Cant Buy Me Love' 'Any Time At All' and 'Things We Said Today' are all fine tracks, a few being among the greatest the Beatles ever recorded. There is just simply no disputing that in my book.<br><br>The problem lies in the entire remainder of the record. It's so stupidly cheerful that it sort of becomes obnoxious. It literally sounds like it's about to go postal at a workplace. And frankly I don't need that in my Beatles records. <br><br>I can totally see why Dylan though John and Paul needed to smoke a little weed.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">KEY TRACK(S): A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, If I Fell, And I Love Her, Tell My Why, Can't Buy Me Love, Any Time at All<br>Overall: 80.769%<br>Therefore: 4/5</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Having never owned the 1987 CD issue nor the original LP, I don't know how the remastering stacks up.  To me this album in its 2009 incarnation sounds great. Not so much that it feels like it was recorded yesterday but simply (like all the Beatles albums) recorded well 45 years ago.  To me this is probably the best album of the early Beatles.  Gone were the track listings dominated by covers and they really (even more so than they had done previously) display the dynamics of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting relationship starting here.  Every song here is top-notch and the musicianship shines.  The first three songs (at the very least) deserve high placement in the ""best of the Beatles"" canon.  The rest deserve placement in the ""better than nearly everyone else"" category (not that they had much competition at this early stage anyway).  As good a starting point for those interested in the early Beatles as <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road</em> is for those curious about the latter Beatles.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">There is a serious error in the intro of ""If I Fell.""  The old version sounds vastly superior to the remastered version.  Just saying.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A fun pop record supporting the Beatles' debut film. The album, like the movie, certainly isn't perfect but it serves its purpose well enough. Side A outdoes B dramatically, and that's about the biggest criticism one can levy.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">just pure kinetic electric energetic youth rock'n'roll sweetness and melodies</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a bad-ass album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">No es mal álbum, pero la verdad es que excepto A Hard Day's Night, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You y Can't Buy Me Love no me gustan en exceso sus canciones.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A collection of silly love songs.

"<span itemprop=""description"">Choice picks: A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A great pop album from the early Beatles. The gems here are a numerous, with tracks like A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better,If I Fell, And I Love Her,Things We Said Today,You Can't Do That, and I'll Be Back. But don't count out the rest of the record as there really isn't a bad song on the damn thing.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The last true album the Beatles ever made; everything else is just a mess.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The best early Beatles album without question. Even if you included the 1965 albums in your definition of <em class=""rymfmt"">early</em>, I might still pick this one over <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em>. <br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> was written entirely by John and Paul--no cover songs and no tunes written by George. This LP, to me, epitomizes Beatlemania like no other record. Certain key singles--including ""She Loves You,"" ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"" and ""From Me to You""--represent the absolute apex of Beatlemania as far as songs go, but where albums are concerned, this is the one that grabs hold of your ears and takes you back in time to when the Fab Four were the kings of the pop world. <br><br>Just listen to the exuberance of the songs; there's undeniable energy from start to finish. Other early albums had some really obvious fillers--songs chosen or written solely to give George or Ringo something to sing, or else simply meet the quota of 14 songs. And while ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" does seem like a bone thrown George's way, and ""I'll Cry Instead"" and ""When I Get Home"" aren't really up to par with the rest, there is a feeling of top-to-bottom quality and enthusiasm that just isn't matched elsewhere in their early catalog.<br><br>Some favorites, besides the two big hits, include ""If I Fell,"" a terrific melodic ballad; ""Tell Me Why,"" a joyous ball of energy; ""Any Time at All,"" which, though essentially a rewrite of ""It Won't Be Long,"" still kicks ass; ""Things We Said Today,"" a dark, moody piece from Paul; and ""I'll Be Back,"" which has an unorthodox structure.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's got some filler on the second half. First album by The Beatles to contain nothing but original material and some of it is good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Temas destacados: este disco tiene la particularidad de que TODOS los temas me gustan más o menos por igual, aunque ninguno me fascine. Es, definitivamente, el disco más homogéneo que escuché.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Flows brilliantly all the way through.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Me and A Hard Day’s Night have a weird history. As a little kid, I used to listen to the Beatles all the time. I know we had this CD, but I never cared about and always wanted to hear 1. After that, I had my typical “Beatles suck” phase. Then, I came to my senses and bought Revolver. I tried to find this album but I couldn’t. I said screw it and went to go listen to Revolver. A few months later, I found the movie A Hard Day’s Night at my library. I fell in love with that movie (No surprise there), but I also fell in love with the songs. The songs in the movie were so good. When I went to find this record, I still couldn’t find it. When I went to go buy it, the CD shops always didn’t have it. This album didn’t want to be in my possession, I think.<br><br>That kind of sucks, because A Hard Day’s Night is one of the Beatles best early records. The first side is all of the songs featured in the movie. The title track, used brilliantly in the film, is one of the Beatles’ best early singles. That opening chord is so iconic. “I Should Have Known Better” is a fun harmonica rocker, with great vocals. It reminds me a lot of “I Want To Hold Your Hand”, with a very similar bridge. “If I Fell” is the first ballad. It’s a very good song. “I’m Happy Just To Dance With You” is George’s vocal on the album. This is a very by-the-numbers song for the Beatles, but it is very catchy and fun.<br><br>“And I Love Her” is probably the best song on this album. Paul McCartney’s ballad is, to put it simply, beautiful. His vocal is especially incredible. This is one of my favorite Beatles songs, it is that good. “Tell Me Why” is a bouncy, country-tinged rocker. The best parts of this song are the vocals – John solo sounds great, but the harmonies are even better. “Can’t Buy Me Love”, the other smash single, is a bluesy rocker. I love the lyrics and Paul’s singing.<br><br>Side 2 is all songs that didn’t make it into the movie. “Any Time At All” is a screaming rocker. The verses are kind of tame, but the choruses are rough. The call and response of the hook is so awesome. “I’ll Cry Instead” has a big country influence. John’s vocal is very nice and the guitar is good too. “Things We Said Today” is a dark sounding ballad written by Paul. The vocals are very good, but the music isn’t anything special.<br><br>“When I Get Home” is a fantastic song with awesome harmonies. I also like the bluesy music and John’s lead vocal. “You Can’t Do That” is a Lennon-penned rocker. The lyrics are biting and the cowbell is awesome. The vocals do not compare to some of Lennon’s other rocker performances, though. The bridge of this song might just be the best part. “I’ll Be Back” is a dark track. I like how the drums fall out of time and I like the acoustic guitar. The vocal performance is also nice.<br><br>A Hard Day’s Night is an essential record for Beatles fans. It is almost flawless and has some of their best tracks. It’s too bad it took me so long to get my hands on it. Hopefully this record likes you and won’t mind being in your collection.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Esse álbum é subestimado. ""Os reis do iê, iê, iê"" (vergonha alheira) só perde pro Abbey Road e Revolver.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">My favorite Beatles album</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">That one silly pop masterpiece to top all other silly pop masterpieces, you know.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Along with Help! this is My personal Favorite Early Beatles Album. These Are Early Days Songs but You Can Still See The Genius Behind Them and How Well Written They Are.<br><br>Best Tracks: If I Fell, I'll Cry Instead, I Should Have Know Better, and And I Love Her.<br><br>Score: 90/100.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Has some great songs like, ""Things We Said Today"", ""If I Fell"", ""And I Love Her"" ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Any Time At All"", ""You Can't Do That"" and ""I'll Be Back"". The only song here I don't like is ""Tell Me Why"", which I consider to be their worst song. It IS their first album to feature all original songs, but strangely (or not if you know the reason) they would follow up with another album with covers all over it. A great record with only one bad track so go for it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not quite as good as most albums being released at the time, but still a must-hear record.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is one of the first Beatles albums I ever heard when I was about 10. I heard it immediately after watching A Hard Day's Night. While it isn't even half as mature as their later work, it's certainly extremely feel-good music. Very cheerful stuff.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">When the Beatles made a film, ""Hard Day's Night"", they were also to make new songs to go with them. They really weren't used to making them for such and such a deadline, but as we know, the Beatles were never leazy buggers, so they got the songs done. This is in fact their first album that includes all Beatles original tracks. And it's irresiistibly poppy. However, it must also be said that the best songs are found in the first half, that are also the songs that were picked for the film itself. With this in mind, it is very easy to see why the songs that were picked for the film are better.<br><br>It still represents how prolific the Beatles, and in particular John Lennon and Paul McCartney were. Rock and roll tracks like the title track and Can't Buy Me Love are well known to all and will always be evergreen. But another rocker, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, is one that isn;t heard so often, and yet, it's very good, as well as the incredibly sweet If I Fell, which just depicts the slow dances that they had at the start of the sixties. And I love is also heart warming. Tell Me Why shows how good a singed John Lennon was, he was really just as good as Paul, only a little rougher.<br><br>The second part is inferior but still good. You Can't Do That isn't just very good, but it also reminds us of a more famous song that came out as a single for ELO. It sort of symbolises how good this band was: what they were releasing as B-side would be released as an a side by other bands to come.<br><br>A HARD DAY'S NIGHT - The first record by the Beatles with all original material, and boy, could they write music! The two sides are slightly unbalanced, but clearly, the quality of the music overall is great, and the band's abilities just seemed to get better and more influencial; just think about Harrison's 12 string guitar for instance on the title track.<br><br>KEY TRACKS - A Hard Day's Night, I Should Have Known Better, And I Love Her, Can't Buy Me Love.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">A really good album, with lots of well-structured songs and some fantastic vocals from Lennon.<br><br>The reason why this album is not regarded as being as good as I believe it is lies in the mastering, especially the transfer to CD.  It is almost impossible to hear the rhythm guitar at times, and other instruments seem to be enlarged and then softened in an instant, breaking any sense of continuity.<br><br>More than any other album in the Beatles catalogue this needs to have a proper remastering/remixing job done on it to restore the balance of the instruments and remove the tinny quality of its present incarnation.  A decent tweaking of your equalizer can do some of the work, such as restoring some of the bass or high register sounds, but it cannot do the essential digging job which is needed to bring the guitar parts to the foreground.<br><br>Still, the songs themselves are timeless.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Pois então, começando a conhecer o trabalho dos Beatles. E esse disco é ótimo, por girar em torno de uma única palavra: simplicidade.<br>É incrível como percebemos esse trabalho com uma pura simplicidade e nada mais, e mesmo assim nos impressiona por ser bom, com músicas que marcariam para sempre a fase inicial dos Beatles. <br>Aposto que na época do disco diziam a eles e eu digo também: Estão de parabéns!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first truly great beatles album.Brilliant beautiful concise bench mark setting pop music,yeah the last few tracks drop the standard a little but what comes before is just stunning.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">fab fave today.........the title track</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's obvious that <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is a transitional album in a lot of ways, so it's hard to be too critical of it - when any band is thrust into the limelight as soon as The Beatles were, there's going to be growing pains, particularly in an era when bands were actually given time to grow (I honestly think there's a chance that if a band appeared now and released albums on the same slow upward quality curve that The Beatles did, they'd be dropped by the fourth album).  Praise, maybe, is due for the fact that this was the first of their albums that featured only original material - without the bravery of that decision they might never have made it to <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em>.  <br><br>It's still an average album, though.  ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" both tower over everything else on here, and both are available on better albums.  Even though this has traditionally been seen as the most iconic period of their careers, I don't think they'd truly found their voices yet.  Beatlemania isn't The Beatles to me.  LSD, intricate studio experiments, the Maharishi, constantly fighting with each other - that's The Beatles.  And that makes <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, and every other early Beatles album, very awkward to listen to for me.  It's like your friend's mother insisting on showing you baby pictures of them.  The last few Beatles albums might be deeply inconsistent, occasionally terrible, and ultimately frustrating, but man, at least they were <em class=""rymfmt"">interesting</em>.  At least they sounded like the work of a band worth obsessing over.  <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> doesn't.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Fact Sheet:<br><br>- Released as the soundtrack to the film with the same name.

"<span itemprop=""description"">They are really starting to hit their straps by this stage.  The songwriting growth from a year earlier is mindboggling.<br><br>Probably the pick of their albums from the first two years.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Really good for this point in their career, especially considering it's all originals.  Side One is definitely way better than Side Two, with five instantly memorable classics out of seven songs, whereas the cream of Side Two is probably ""Things We Said Today"", which if you ask people to start naming Beatles songs will probably get thought of, if it's thought of it at all, after around seventy other Beatles songs, and even then the person in question will probably have asked you twice if ""Instant Karma"" counts as a Beatles song.  That's not to say it's bad, mind you.  Anyway it<em> is </em>a '64 album and it<em> does </em>have filler out the wazoo, so I can't rate it too highly, but it's the best Beatles album pre-Rubber Soul, if it's considered acceptable to praise records by making up totally arbitrary categories in which they excel.<br><br>The movie is totally awesome as well.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A Hard Day’s Night seems to be the album where The Beatles really found their voice. No more covers - just 14 amazing compositions by Lennon and McCartney. Though it lacks the musical experimentation and the lyrical depth that would start to appear on Rubber Soul and fully blossom on Revolver, this is a top-notch album without any filler.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Perhaps the finest collection of early Beatles' songwriting, but not usually one I prefer to reach for; instead I opt for the energy of their debut, relative to which this one is pretty lacking in oomph, I guess. Very memorable, but almost dull performances when digested all at once. Still a nice enough listen on occasion.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">My favorite Beatles album which has my favorite Beatles song on it... ""And I Love Her"".</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a completely overrated release which features a few classics and countless worthless pop numbers.  And I Love Her is a beautiful song, the title track is great, and Can't Buy Me Love gets the wild card for the only good song that isn't ridiculously overplayed.  The rest of the songs are boring at best and no amount of false enthusiasm in Lennon's voice can really change that.  <br><br>It is often said that this is the point where the Beatles became a band capable of creating an full album.  But in my eyes that point didn't come along for quite some time.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">From the opening twang of A Hard Day's Night, this seminal album grabs you and puts you front row/centre in Beatlemania. Along with the film document of the same name, AHDN took the world by storm, offering up a feast of new and exciting pop. Everything we love about the mop-topped early Beatles is here: immediately hummable tunes by the foremost songsmiths of pop music, the ear-friendly vocal harmonies, the catchy and energetic guitar hooks, Paul's melodious basslines, and Ringo's joyous cymbal and cowbell-driven backbeat. The band and their music here represented the ""innocence"" of youth and pop songs of the time. Songs of love, lost love, love, and love. Well, that's rock'n' roll, isn't it? <br><br>I have been able to enjoy Japanese 24-bit remasters of some Beatles albums, and AHDN really benefits from the improved sound and the successful STEREO treatment. <br><br>I revisit this album often, and especially enjoy my current favourites ""If I Fell"", ""Things we said today"", ""You can't do that"", and ""I'll be back"". So much timeless music that will surely still have a place in audio players around the world 100 years from now.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Celui-ci semble un peu plus populaire que les deux précédents. Effet film ou réelle supériorité?<br><br>C'est la stricte continuité de <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> en terme de qualité de  songwriting hormis le fait notable que toutes les chansons sont ici signées Lennon/McCartney. J'avoue que je suis un peu overdosé de ""A Hard Day's Night"" et préfère me rabattre sur ""And I Love Her"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""Things We Said Today"" ou ""I'll Be Back"". Tous les titres sont biens mais pour moi aucun ne supplante un ""It Won't be Long"" ou un ""Please Please Me"" sur les précédents albums. On dirait que ce disque a un peu moins de ""patate"", au niveau production je soupçonne qu'on ait un peu éloigner Ringo et donner plus d'espace aux voix.<br><br>Un album qui a mis le feu aux poudres de la Beatlemania, ça n'est pas un de mes préféré de la première période mais ça reste une valeur sure.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">This has like, two good songs on it. The rest just kinda doesn't work for me. Why is this tagged tradeable, though? I love the Beatles. I should hang on to this.

The Rolling Stones were doing blues at this point. just salty and sexy. The Beatles were doing sap-master pop. No wonder Lennon wasn<br>t into it.

The great benefit of this is that the album seems to flow along swiftly without getting bogged down anywhere. Of course, this doubles as the soundtrack to the movie of the same name that starred the band, but having not seen the film I couldn’t tell you whether it works well in that environment or not.<br><br>Favourites here include “A Hard Day’s Night”, “I Should Have know Better”, “If I Fell”, “Can’t Buy Me Love” and “I’ll Be Back”.<br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Rating:</strong> One of my favourite Beatles albums. 3.5/5.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I am fully aware of the Beatles reputation, but this is just pop bullshit equivalent to the Backstreet Boys of the 1960's. screaming girls and pop culture publicity. It's absolute generic garbage. The Beatles were a fantastic band, but before Rubber Soul they had the must awful krapp that is regarded as some of the best of rock. It's not rock at all it's souless pop. Now Eleanor Rigby, that was genious. All I have to say is thank you to the Beatles for maturing past this terrible immature phase.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">By now The Beatles are hitting their stride, still a fair amount of nothing but the GREAT songs are starting to come through. The Title Track, ""Tell Me Why"" and ""Any Time At All"" are close to being classics as the Lennon/McCartney songwriting gets stronger.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Relative to the drivel that other rock bands were recording at the time, this is maybe the greatest album in rock history. It towers over the competition in a way that no other Beatles album ever did. By the time the Beatles progressed through the late 1960's, many other artists had reached their level of brilliance. They had not yet caught up in 1964, and some had not even entered the ballpark yet.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">9.3<br><br>""A Hard Day's Night"" is one of the Beatles ""early career"" albums. An album filled with quickie old school pop fixies. An album in which the longest track clocks in at  two minutes &amp; forty four seconds. Every song is a classic pop rock tune with some of the most simplistic lyrics and catchiest moments in the Beatles discography. If you're looking for some good Beatles rockers, you will definitely be disappointed. The rockiest song is probably the opening ""A Hard Day's Night"". Each song is played pretty fast, calmly, and ferociously executed well with love. The songwriting on ""A Hard Day's Night"" is very weak compared to the Beatles discography as a whole. <br><br>The instrumentals and vocal hooks are all conjuncted together as well as usual. In that department the Beatles have always been at the top of their game. There just seemed to be a bit of a learning curve when it came to their songwriting capabilities. If anyone could get away with repetitiveness and simplicity without sounding too cheesy or boring you to death, it was the Beatles who had that power.  ""A Hard Day's Night"" is great stuff when thought about as a good old pop album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Arguably the first power-pop record (hat tip to the friend of mine who turned me on to the Beatles).  This one was a huge step forward for the Fabs and pop in general, and is a great snapshot of the '50's sound giving way to the '60's sound.  The songs are brimming over with confidence; in the authorized bio <strong class=""rymfmt"">Many Years From Now</strong>, Paul recounts how Ringo came up with the album's title (one of his famous malapropisms) and John volunteered to write the title track overnight.  The next day, John came in with the tune in his head and the lyrics scribbled on a napkin, and he (and maybe Paul) finished off the middle eight (""when I'm home..."") in the space of about 20 minutes.<br><br>John dominates this record in the same way Paul dominates <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Pepper</em>: he's wildly prolific, and the sole writer of about half the songs.  Still, Paul contributes some of the best songs here, just as John contributed some standouts on <em class=""rymfmt"">Pepper</em>.  Paul's songs are ""Cant Buy Me Love"", ""And I Love Her"", and ""Things We Said Today"", a pretty impressive and diverse set.  Besides the title track, ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" (which was so dorky they gave it to George to sing) and the close-harmony numbers ""If I Fell"" and ""I'll Be Back"" are co-written; the remainder are all John alone.  In general, as John said, each sang the parts he wrote.  See <strong class=""rymfmt"">Many Years From Now</strong> for details on songwriting credits; for this album, there's no major disagreement between Paul's recollections and John's.<br><br>""Oldie"" is a very much a relative term; for me, almost everything prior to '65 sounds like an oldie.  The pot started bubbling rapidly thereafter (ha ha -- lots of great hits, nudge nudge), and by '67 the classic rock sound was really cooking, fully flowering around around the turn of the decade.  (That said, the lightweight, twee '50's sound never really went away, as top 40 radio attested for many years, and kinda still does.)  Even though this album sounds kind of quaint, I really like it; probably my favorite pop record prior to the classic rock era.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> was the first Beatles album to consist solely of original Lennon/McCartney songs.  For any band in 1964 to release an entire album of self-penned material without a single cover version was a major achievement.  Lennon fans in particular will love <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> as he dominates the album with ten of the thirteen songs, while Paul McCartney was responsible for the other three.  The first side of the album was the soundtrack to the movie <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, but the second side is equally good.<br><br>The title track with its instantly recognisable opening chord provides a very strong start to the album and was also a number one hit.  John's lyrics deal with the tiredness the singer feels after a hard day at work but how when he comes home, the things that his lover does make him 'feel all right'.  The title ""A Hard Day's Night"" was inspired by a remark made by Ringo after a busy night's work.  The other number one single from the album was Paul's ""Can't Buy Me Love"", a catchy rock 'n' roll song, though it has never been one of my favourite Beatles singles.  I actually prefer Paul's other two tracks on the album - ""And I Love Her"" is a gorgeous sophisticated ballad and ""Things We Said Today"" is simply a brilliant song, moody and atmospheric.  Both of these tracks are highlights of the album for me.<br><br>My favourite song on <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> however, is probably John's ""If I Fell"", a lovely ballad that proved it wasn't only Paul who could come up with beautiful melodies.  ""I'll Be Back"" is another little gem - a darker, more mature sounding song with great guitar and vocals.   ""Tell Me Why"" and ""Anytime At All"" are both enjoyable pop songs, as is ""I Should Have Known Better"", a bouncy, uplifting song with great vocals from John and prominent harmonica.  There are no songs written by George on this album, but he gets his chance to sing on ""I'm Happy Just To Dance With You""; it's a decent song with good rhythm guitar, but not a favourite of mine.  <br><br>The country-style ""I'll Cry Instead"" gives another early example of John's introspective lyrics such as 'I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet' and 'Don't want to cry when there's people there, I get shy when they start to stare'.  ""When I Get Home"" is another lively pop song from John.  The poor lyrics let it down ('I'm gonna love her till the cows come home') but I've always liked it anyway.  Finally, ""You Can't Do That"" is another contender for the title of best song on the album.  It's a heavy bluesy rocker with great guitar from both John and George.  The lyrics are again semi-autobiographical - a possessive lover warning his girlfriend not to cheat on him.  Lennon would return to this theme in later songs such as ""Run For Your Life"".          <br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> represented a big step forward from their previous two albums and is great fun to listen to.       <br><br>Rating: 4.5/5<br>Highlights: I Should Have Known Better, If I Fell, And I Love Her, Things We Said Today, You Can't Do That</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Eigentlich wurde bereits millionenfach alles gesagt. Muss ich noch auf den Haufen scheissen? Ich muss: meine persönlichen Favoriten auf der Scheibe sind: ""If I Fell"", ""And I Lover Her"", und ""I'll Be Back"".<br><br>Kaufempfehlung? Ohne Worte - diese Scheibe darf in keiner Sammlung fehlen.<br><br>Trivia:<br><br>A1 ""A Hard Day's Night""<br><br>The title was taken from an expression Ringo used to say. In a 1964 interview with DJ Dave Hull, Ringo explained: ""We went to do a job, and we'd worked all day and we happened to work all night. I came up still thinking it was day I suppose, and I said, 'It's been a hard day...' and I looked around and saw it was dark so I said, 'Night!' So we came to 'A Hard Day's Night.'""<br>John Lennon used the phrase ""A hard day's night"" in a his book In His Own Write before it was used as a song or movie title. He used it in the short story (more of a vignette) titled ""Sad Michael."" An excerpt: ""There was no reason for Michael to be sad that morning, (the little wretch): everyone liked him, (the scab). He'd had a hard day's night that day, for Michael was a Cocky Watchtower."" John Lennon wrote this song, which contains long, repeating notes that are uncommon in Pop music. Even more unusual, Lennon sang it in glissando: ""haaaard days night..."". The melody resembles the Irish Folk song ""Donall Og,"" with the same pentatonic, and small glissandos. Such glissandos you even find in the English ballad ""Three Babes.""<br>Albert Goldman wrote in his 1980 book The Lives of John Lennon, ""The whole composition is written in mixolydic key, an old key which was abandoned in the beginning of the seventeenth century, but is maintained in English and Irish Folk music."" This was the title song to the first of 5 Beatles movies. It got 2 Oscar nominations and was a hit with critics and audiences. At the time, a lot of movies were made starring musicians, but most were showcases for the singers and not very good (think Elvis movies). A Hard Day's Night  was a surprise because it actually had cinematic value. It even sold well when it was released on DVD many years later.<br><br>When the deal was made to make the movie, The Beatles had not yet caught on in America and there were fairly low expectations for the film, as The Beatles were thought of as a fad that would soon pass. By the time filming began, The Beatles were huge and it was clear that a lot of people would see the movie. The studio considered putting more money into the film, but they decided to stick with the original modest budget. In order to save money, it was shot in black and white.<br><br>The movie presented The Beatles as 4 distinct personalities, which changed the way they were marketed. Previously, they were always presented as a unified group, but it became clear that fans loved seeing their differences and began to associate with them individually. The concept of focusing on individual personalities in a band continues to this day, as groups like The Spice Girls and The Backstreet Boys are marketed with a focus on the various traits of the members, allowing fans to get to know them better. The last song in the movie soundtrack to be composed, the motion picture was being produced when Ringo made his statement that inspired the song (original movie title: Beatlemania). Walter Shenson, who was the movie producer of A Hard Day's Night, told PBS that he said to John, ""You need to write a song that will incorporate the movie's title,"" and Shenson was amazed when John came in the very next day with the song. He thought John would labor over it for days or weeks. Phil Collins was one of the school kids brought in as extras for a scene in the movie where The Beatles perform. He didn't make the cut, but years later, the film's producer gave Collins the outtake footage with him in it and had Collins add commentary to the DVD release. Lennon sang lead and Paul McCartney sang the middle sequences. John had Paul sing the middle section because he felt Paul had the more appropriate vocal range for it. Surprisingly, he insisted on singing a higher harmonization in ""From Me To You"" only a year earlier because he said he could sing the higher stuff better than Paul. The Beatles recorded this in 9 takes on Thursday, April 16, 1964. It was written and recorded in a little more than 24 hours. It had to be done quickly when film name was changed from ""Beatlemania!"" to ""A Hard Day's Night."" In 1964, the Beatles won 2 Grammy awards. The first Grammy was Best New Artist. The second Grammy was Best Performance By A Vocal Group, which was awarded to this song. At the 2002 Super Bowl, where Paul McCartney performed ""Freedom,"" Terry Bradshaw started singing this with McCartney when Paul joined the Fox announcers on the set. The Hard Day's Night Hotel opened in Liverpool in 2003. It is next to The Cavern Club, where The Beatles played many of their early shows.<br><br>A2 ""I Should Have Known Better""<br><br>Composed by John Lennon, at first he ""hammers the melody on the same note."" (The Italian composer Monteverdi discovered the effect of hammering on the same note. He called the style ""stile concitato""). Then comes the middle part in long notes. The middle part has a change of keynote, which is unusual with such a change in a middle part. And then the rise in falsetto. Typical of Lennon's songs, there is also a rise of excitement. When you think that the mood will cool a little - when you come to the middle part - the excitement instead increases. he Beatles performed this in their first movie, A Hard Day's Night. It was used in a scene where The Beatles sing it to a group of girls, one of which was played by an actress named Pattie Boyd. This was the first time George Harrison met her - he fell for her and married her a few years later. They divorced in 1977, and Pattie married Harrison's friend Eric Clapton in 1979. That marriage also ended in divorce, but along the way, Pattie inspired some of the most famous songs of all time, including The Beatles' ""Something"" and Clapton's ""Layla."" This was done in 3 takes on Tuesday, February 25, 1964. But it didn't end there - they completely remade it the next day. The take you hear on record is Take 22. John Lennon's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out. This was released as the B-side of ""A Hard Day's Night."" Lennon played the harmonica solo. McCartney played a 12-string electric guitar on this track.<br><br>A3 ""If I Fell""<br><br>John Lennon wrote this song, which may have been influenced by the ambivalence he felt during his first marriage. Lennon called this song ""my first attempt at a ballad... it's semi autobiographical, but not consciously."" Lennon and McCartney sang together into the same microphone when recording this song. John sang the lead on the intro, then Paul sang in a higher lead while John sang harmony. The structure of the song is rather intriguing. It opens with an intro that contains no musical elements found in the rest of the song, and the body of this song has no real verse/chorus structure, just 2 verses that each turn halfway through on an unexpected chord.<br>The song is very expressive, with large intervals between the notes in a quasi-modal way. Typical of Lennon are the emphasis on three recurrent long notes (""...give my heart...""). It has similarities with John Dunstable's motet ""Quam pulchra es"" from the fifteenth century. The introduction is also unusual, with four modulations - even tighter than most music from late romantic music. At the end of the second time that they sing, ""Would be sad if our new love was in vain,"" McCartney's voice cracks on ""vain,"" but on newer releases of the song this mistake is covered over. There were a few demos of this song recorded in January 1964 before The Beatles came to America. The proper recording came on Thursday, February 27, 1964. The take you hear on the album is Take 15. The Beatles performed this in the movie A Hard Day's Night. It was used in a scene where they perform to a group of school kids in a theater. The kids were all borrowed from nearby schools, and had no idea they would see The Beatles. On of the kids was 13-year-old Phil Collins, who didn't make the final cut, but was given outtakes with him in it years later when he contributed commentary for the DVD release of the movie. This was used as the B-side of ""And I Love Her."" During their 1964 tour, Lennon had some fun with McCartney, adding the word ""over"" when Paul introduced the song.<br><br>A 4 ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You""<br><br>John Lennon and Paul McCartney wrote this as a showcase song for George Harrison, who sang lead. George had already written only one Beatles song by this point: ""Don't Bother Me."" Typical of the early Beatles, this is a very innocent song - the singer is taking it slow, as he's OK just dancing with the girl of his dreams. There is an old-time Irving Berlin/Cole Porter feel to the song, focusing on the de-lightful feeling of being smitten. The Beatles performed this in their movie A Hard Day's Night, giving Harrison some quality screen time. John Lennon wrote most of this song. Typical of his style, the first short notes are followed with tree longer notes. The Irvin Berlin influence comes when the melody rises in the five notes in ""kiss or hold your hand..."" In the cadence, Lennon jokes: he repeats the mentioned five notes, but just sinks it with a third. The Beatles recorded this on Sunday, March 1, 1964 in 4 takes. Recording on a Sunday was very rare at the time.<br><br>A5 ""And I Love Her""<br><br>Paul McCartney wrote most of this song, and in a 1984 interview with Playboy  magazine, he stated, ""It's just a love song; no, it wasn't for anyone."" That was probably the chivalrous thing to do, as by then he was 15 years into his marriage to Linda. When he wrote the song, he was dating an actress named Jane Asher. For a while, they were the most popular couple in England. After they broke up in 1968, McCartney married Linda Eastman and Asher became a proficient author. She runs her own business called ""Jane Asher Party Cakes."" This was one of the first pop songs with a title that starts in mid-sentence. Paul was inspired by songs such as Perry Como's ""And I Love Her So."" Most of the songs on the album A Hard Days Night are Lennon compositions. Lennon helped out with the middle part of this song, but it's mostly the work of McCartney. Structurally, the song is fairly conventional, with a clear melody in A+A+B+A system similar to popular music from the '30s that Irving Berlin wrote. This is the second most covered Beatles song with 372 versions recorded by 1972. Their most-covered track is ""Yesterday."" Paul always intended this to be a ballad. He felt that all of their albums, regardless of how ""rocky"" they were, should have at least one ballad ""to enrich the show."" It's the reason he added ""Till There Was You"" to With The Beatles. The Beatles Anthology 1 album has a much faster version that includes both drums and George's 12-string electric guitar, but that wasn't the original intent. The take you hear on record is Take 21. Ringo played the bongos on this track, and George Harrison played the acoustic guitar solo. The guitar duo Santo &amp; Johnny recorded a mellow surf instrumental version of this song in 1965 which was a huge hit in Mexico. Santo &amp; Johnny are known for their #1 hit ""Sleep Walk."" Despite the fact that he wrote 35% of this song (the middle eight), John Lennon called this ""Paul's first 'Yesterday.'"" This was the first Beatles recording using purely acoustic instruments. Paul once stated ""This was the first song that I impressed myself with.""<br><br>A6 ""Tell Me Why""<br><br>John Lennon, whose parents separated when he was 3 years old, has said that the lyrics were about children whose parents split up. Apparently, he didn't put a great deal of effort into the song, staing: ""They needed another upbeat song, and I just knocked it off."" This was performed in The Beatles movie A Hard Day's Night. It was The Beatles first movie, and the group was not yet popular in America when the deal was signed to make it. Before filming began, The Beatles became huge and the movie did very well. John and Paul sang lead vocals, but Lennon was double-tracked to create a 3 part harmony. This was recorded on Thursday, February 27, 1964. Take 8 was used.<br><br>A7 ""	Can't Buy Me Love""<br><br>Paul McCartney wrote this song. Despite rumors to the contrary, he claimed it was not about a prostitute. Rather, the song makes a simple yet profound statement on what matters most in life. The word ""Love"" appeared in many Beatles lyrics, especially in their early songs. This song was recorded on January 29, 1964 in Paris, although when The Beatles returned to Britain, George Harrison decided to overdub another lead guitar part in London. The original solo is still audible in the background. This was one of the first Pop songs to start with the chorus rather than a verse. That was producer George Martin's idea. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" was used as the title for a popcorn movie starring Patrick Dempsey in 1987. In the film, his character goes from ""totally geek to totally chic"" by paying a popular girl to pretend they are dating. Gerardo, who sang ""Rico Suave,"" was also in the movie. This was used in the first Beatles movie, A Hard Day's Night, which was re-released in 2000. It was used to replace ""I'll Cry Instead,"" which the film's director Dick Lester thought was an inappropriate song to use when the Beatles were to break out and have some fun. This replaced ""Roll Over Beethoven""/""Please Mr. Postman"" as the single to be released by Capitol Records USA in March 1964.<br><br>B1 ""Any Time At All""<br><br>This is one of those songs that was finished ""on the fly"" so to speak. John Lennon had it half written when they went into the studio with it and he just finished it up and recorded it there. He called it, ""An effort at writing 'It Won't Be Long'... with me shouting."" Lennon's original draft of this song had two extra verses that he left off, the last of which started, ""I'll be waiting here all alone/Just like I've always done."" He left them off because he felt they didn't really advance the story in the song. Lennon's handwritten lyrics were auctioned for 6000 pounds in 1988. This is one of the songs not in the film A Hard Day's Night which was written to fill out the album. Lennon wrote 10 of the 13 songs on A Hard Day's Night. In his Playboy  interview in September of 1980, he went through the entire Lennon/McCartney catalogue song by song, and stated which bits of the songs were his and which were Paul's. This was the first time we learned specifically about the songwriting breakdown between John and Paul. Albert Goldman thought in his book The Lives of John Lennon that the refrain was fantastic: ""It sounds as a pistol shot... his voice is burning in a true gospel frenzy... he had a remarkable ability to utter cries from the deep of his soul.""<br><br>B2 ""I'll Cry Instead""<br><br>This was intended for the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night, but it was replaced by ""Can't Buy Me Love."" The Beatles recorded this in 2 sections that were then edited together. There is an extra verse on US album version.<br><br>B3 ""Things We Said Today""<br><br>Paul McCartney wrote this while he was on vacation in The Bahamas and away from his girlfriend. McCartney's vocal was double-tracked to make it stand out. Maureen McGovern recorded this and ""For No One"" as a 2-song medley for her 1992 album Baby I'm Yours.<br><br>B4 ""When I Get Home""<br><br>John Lennon wrote the lyrics to this song, which is about going home to his girlfriend.<br><br>B5 ""You Can't Do That""<br><br>The Beatles recorded this in 9 takes on George Harrison's 21st Birthday (the same session as ""And I Love Her"" and ""I Should Have Known Better""), although in May, producer George Martin overdubbed a piano making a 10th take that wasn't used. The one that saw the light of the day was Take 9. This was filmed for the movie A Hard Day's Night, but did not make the cut. It was, however, included on the movie's soundtrack, which was released by the film's production company United Artists. Since United Artists had the soundtrack rights, The Beatles' American label, Capitol, released it as the B-side of ""Can't Buy Me Love."" John Lennon played lead guitar. He normally played rhythm while George Harrison played lead. This was the first Beatles song where George Harrison played a 12 string guitar. Ringo played the cowbell. Harry Nilsson covered this song on his 1967 debut album, Pandemonium Shadow Show as a tribute to The Beatles' music in general. It is performed at a slower tempo, and throughout the song lines from other Beatles songs are sung in counterpoint, ending with the line ""Strawberry Beatles Forever."" Lennon told British journalist Ray Connolly that this song was his attempt at being pioneering American soul singer Wilson Pickett.<br><br>B6 ""I'll Be Back""<br><br>John Lennon created this song around the chords of Del Shannon's ""Runaway."" It was credited to Lennon/McCartney, but was written mostly by John. In the US, this was released on the album Beatles 65. Lennon's original intent for this song was for it to be a waltz. The demo The Beatles recorded at the last session for A Hard Day's Night is performed in this style.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Probably my favorite of the Beatles. The one I listened to when i was a kid, too. My dad used to play it on our vacations. He played other ones, but I never really payed much mind to them. When I heard them recently, I kinda understood why. They're all pretty good, but this one is solid througout.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The early Beatles vs late Beatles debate has traditionally been won (in my head, at least) by the late-period Beatles. Their history generally started for me with <em class=""rymfmt"">Revolver</em> and peaked at <em class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</em>. It was hearing the early songs over and over while my wife played the <em class=""rymfmt"">1</em> compilation that piqued my interest in spending more time with those first albums - the ones that sparked Beatlemania in all its insanity. Of their early career, this one's the standout for me. Thirteen tracks of pure rock'n'roll joy. From the first moments, when that iconic chord that opens the title track comes stinging through your speakers, you know you're in for something great and they don't let up with great song after great song, piling up them up with those ringing guitars and perfect harmonies and indelible melodies. It's the album that shows the Lennon/McCartney partnership to greatest effect - it's the first album with all their own songs and it's also where their talents dovetailed. From here on out, they'd start to diverge but this, right here, is them working in perfect unison. There's not a dud track on here (and there's not a Ringo-sung track on here either - I'm not saying that one necessarily follows the other but, well, y'know). It's one of those rare album astrological convergences where an important moment in music history is also a great moment in music history.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Masterpiece.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Weaker at the end but still a full strong Bubble Gum Pop album.<br>Melody: 3,5<br>Creativity: 2</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The instrumentals are just sweet. The rest of the songs; they're pretty good. There is better Beatles stuff out there, but this stuff is definitely far from bad.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">One of their best early albums; definitely more ""ballad-centric"". The movie is quite excellent too. The title track is the real highlight, but also good is ""And I Love Her"" ""If I Fell"" ""Can't Buy Me Love"" and ""This Boy"".</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">favorite of early Beatles</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a good album, I totally reccomend this joint. It's not even that long either, because it only takes like 30 minutes to go through it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is where the Beatles began to kick it into legendary territory.  Just an amazing album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Starts off really well, but to many songs on there just to get an album out for the film.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">First Beatle album with no covers. It continues the same way as all of their albums before this. The pop rock-Beatles never hit me as hard as their albums after Revolver. Of course the stuff in here isn't bad, but it isn't powerful enough to be perfect. Actually the A-side is very good. Maybe a little bit too pop sounding, but still really good. Only ""Tell Me Why"" is a boring one. Second side is the weaker one in here, but it still doesn't suck. Well, maybe couple of the songs do. I mean that songs like ""Any Time at All"" and ""You Can't Do That"" are so damn booooooring. ""Things We Said Today"" is really, really and I mean really strong. Maybe the best one in the whole disc. Rest of the songs in the B-side are nothing special.<br><br>A-side was worth of four stars and the B-side was average, so I will rate this record with three stars. This isn't the stuff I want to hear from The Beatles, but it's still enjoyable and OK overall.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Almost the first great Beatles record, but not quite. Some amazing melodies here. ""If I Fell"" is one of the prettiest tunes I have ever heard.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Bello,per carità, ma secondo me non uno dei migliori</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles' first album of all originals and their first masterpiece.  There are some utterly beautiful songs on this album including ""If I Fell"", ""And I Love Her"", ""Things We Said Today"", and ""I'll Be Back"".  You can also here the beginnings of instrumental diversity here.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I solid pop album, but I never really understood the people that called this just as good as The Beatles' later efforts.<br><br>The standout tracks re ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"", ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"".<br><br>It just feels dated, and those vocal harmonies can get annoying after a while. (Since none of them were terrific singers, with the exception of Paul.)</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In 1964 writing an all original album was basically unheard of in rock music this was while Dylan was a folk artist. This album gave birth to many folk rock acts including the Byrds. The Beatles use of the twelve string jangle sound was done here before the Byrds. The use of folk with rock Things We Said Today and Ill Be Back was also done a year before the folk rock craze. This is most likely the underrated album the Beatles created. The Beatles are one of the pioneers in the use of folk with rock and the use of twelve string jangle sound.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A piece of music-history!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Definitley a solid release, but not a favorite. And that's simply due to the general theme of the lyrics. This record's a bit too...adolescent if that makes sense. Best song: ""If I Fell""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">1 A Hard Day's Night  *****<br>2 I Should Have Known Better  ****<br>3 If I Fell  ***1/2<br>4 I'm Happy Just to Dance With You  ****<br>5 And I Love Her  *****<br>6 Tell Me Why  ***1/2<br>7 Can't Buy Me Love ****1/2 <br>8 Any Time at All  ****<br>9 I'll Cry Instead ****<br>10 Things We Said Today  ***1/2<br>11 When I Get Home  ***1/2<br>12 You Can't Do That ***1/2<br>13 I'll Be Back  ***1/2<br>  Absolutely entertaining Album. I enjoyed it quite a bit. I am really hearing these albums for the first time. Before I only ever heard compilations. Except, I once owned Sgt. Pepper, and the white album. This one is also a lot of fun.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">¿Se pueden poner 6 estrellas?</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles greatest early release. All Lennon and McCartney (their only album that is) this is the soundtrack to what was Beatlemania.<br>Anyone who says they didn't release any classic albums prior to Rubber Soul is missing out on the best that early 60's pop had to offer.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">“I Should Have Known Better” gets my vote as the very first song of the later Beatles – there’s just something really special about this song, a more mature sound, it’s a corker! “If I Fell” is a beautiful, rich ballad and “Tell Me Why” is another standout, which I first heard on the cartoon show! And the wild-rockin’ title track, of course. In fact, as with <em class=""rymfmt"">Help!</em>, the first side is quite solid.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Lotsa good basic Rock'n'Roll. The Beatles were actually good even for being so famous. I like all of their early work the best.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not amazing, but still a nice album.<br><br>As most early Beatles albums are, this one is filled with love songs. I don't play this album over and over simply because I get sick of all the love. (How 'bout some anger for once?) Nevertheless, some of these songs are classics. Namely...<br><br>""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""I Should Have Known Better,"" ""If I Fell,"" ""And I Love Her,"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love.""<br><br>Basically, only the first half of the album is worth listening to. But that's just my opinion. A good album, all in all.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">In April of 1964, The Beatles would dislodge themselves from the top of the charts for a second time with ""Can't Buy Me Love"" knocking the previous topper ""She Loves You"" down to the #3 position. ""Can't Buy Me Love"" would stay at #1 for five weeks giving the band a total of fourteen consecutive weeks on top of Billboard's Hot 100 with three #1 hits in a row. The Beatles also maintained a monopoly of the top five, and had 14 songs dotting the charts in one particular week. This album was released at the peak of 'Beatlemania', and it is arguably the greatest achievement The Fab Four would have before their renaissance era (pot-smoking days) began.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Such a great album, brilliant... just brilliant.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Фактически, я вырос на этой пластинке.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles' first great album (also their first not to include covers).  Thing would get better, but still holds up in its own right.  Highlights: ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Can't Buy Me Love""</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A Beatles album full of love songs.  And more love songs.  And a few filler love songs.  A nice listen but without much variety.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's a pity this CD release is in mono. The original stereo version is an example of early mixing without using the ping-pong effect. <br>Bass is flat and punch is missing. They could have done better!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I owe my Dad for getting me into the Beatles and this was the first album I ever heard by them.<br>I was only 6 or 7 when I first heard this.  Kids used to laugh at me for liking the Beatles and Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer instead of rap and hip hop but who looks like the dickheads now!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">they have arrived; their first perfect album; rock out yeah!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is when the Beatles started showing hints of their songwriting genius. The title track, And I love her, Can't buy me Love and Things we said Today are the proof of that.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I Should Have Known Better is a killer song, as are most of these, but for me, not the finest hour of the early Beatles--I'd probably go with Help! for that one...  No need for a qualitative review on anything Beatles-oriented...</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><a title=""[Label96]"" href=""/label/capitol_records/"" class=""label"">Capitol Records</a> took great pride in putting the screws to Beatles fans.  This is the North American version of the soundtrack for The Beatles film <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Film9905]"" href=""/film/a_hard_days_night/"" class=""film"">A Hard Day's Night</a></em>.  It's playlist is based on the twelve track UK LP, <em class=""rymfmt""><a title=""[Album208]"" href=""/release/album/the-beatles/a-hard-days-night-84/"" class=""album"">A Hard Day's Night</a></em>, but four of the songs have been exchanged for George Martin's instrumentals he had scored for the film.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">A great album with great pop songs. My favorite from them pre-Rubber Soul.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Now this shit rocks! ""Any Time At All"" may be my favorite Beatles song, but that's always a tough call.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Original Toshiba Odeon 1st edition in mint condition on red PVC. My prized possession. The Japan only cover is cool as well.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The sound on this vinyl issue is even better than on the 1987 CD reissue. It's stereo and it's got a better bass sound.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Considering the time between this and<em> Please Please Me </em>is a matter of, at most, a year, the improvement shown here is incredible. This and<em> Help! </em>are probably the best of the Beatles records for pure pop value for money, and the consistency of song quality is just amazing. There are clear highlights - the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" - but the rest of the record is simply a bunch of great, albeit lesser, pop songs, which is not something anyone should turn their nose up at. A great improvement over their already respectable output up to this point, and a fine album in general.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Comparing the Beatles album to others albums of the same period aways proves the BEATLES to miles ahead of everyone.  The BEATLES had the knack for topping themselves with each release.  This one is unbelievable.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Un clásico de la historia de la música, una sucesión de canciones que marcaron mucho de la historia posterior del rock. Un disco que debe considerarse como un ""manifiesto rockero"", más allá de los análisis que se puedan hacer de su música. Con respecto a la música poco puede decirse que sea inédito; es básicamente un disco de transición entre el ""rock &amp; roll"" originario y el ""rock"" que se desarrollaría posteriormente. Un disco absolutamente imprescindible. Puntaje normalizado: 4,67</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Whimsical, giddy pop at its best. It achieves everything it sets out to accomplish.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Best Song: Either one of the first two songs<br><br>Other Highlights: If I Fell, I'm Happy Just to Dance with You, And I Love Her, Tell Me Why, Things We Said Today, I'll Be Back</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Here're the boys on the edge of 'that awesome 60s band, The Beatles', and about to become <em class=""rymfmt"">The Beatles</em> who need no introduction. From here on out, it's Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Pepper... <br><br>'A Hard Day's Night' displays a moodiness they seem to have kept behind a veil on previous releases. John gets comfortable in his song writing while ending a comfortable phase of his life, Paul's still Paul, and everybody's under-estimating George and Ringo. <br><br>Basically, they're about to put down the shaker eggs.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Third time is the charm. The Beatles finally created a great album.<br><br>This is refreshing. While <em class=""rymfmt"">Please Please Me</em> and <em class=""rymfmt"">With The Beatles</em> had been ok, they were derivatives of 50's Rock stars from America. On <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, they made a record that sounds new and akin to, well, The Beatles. Certainly the fact that this was 100% self penned helped on that front. The songs are catchy, memorable, and well produced. Hit play on the album and tell me how far you get before you encounter a bad song. It’s more than two or three this time. The title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" were deserving #1 hits. The real crowning achievement here, however, is ""If I Fell"", a perfect capture of the insecurity that comes from a breakup and the subsequent attempt to find new love. The B side is weaker, but is still better than any on their prior efforts. “Anytime at All”, “I’ll Be Back”, and “You Can’t Do That” are the best on this part of the record- three great examples of music during Beatlemania. <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night </em> actually comes close to perfect, but it sadly features two songs that are rather subpar (“Tell Me Why” and “When I Get Home”)<br><br>The Beatles had never shown their talent like this before. Easy on the ears, energetic, and of a high quality, <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> marks the first in a string of must own Beatles records. Of course, the quality of the <em class=""rymfmt""> album </em> is a little bit of an accident- as they would prove on <em class=""rymfmt""> Beatles for Sale </em>, the LP format was still an afterthought. But with songs as strong as these, what is supposed to be the filler? Music was about to change, and this was a catalyst.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> marked The Beatles' first big leap (and was accompanied by an equally brilliant film). They've discarded the tried-and-true covers, and the album is stacked with splendid Lennon/McCartney originals. Literally every single song on the album is amazing; not only is the songwriting better and far more consistent, but you can tell they've grown and improved as a band. The playing is tight and energetic, the vocals emotive, the harmonies obscenely catchy. The early period Beatles don't get much better than the title track, with that unforgettable opening chord, George's excellent double-tracked guitar solo, and the mesmerizing arpeggio that brings it to a fade. But there are contenders, most notably ""Can't Buy Me Love,"" the first song featuring only one singing Beatle, Paul. His voice is strong enough that it doesn't need to be supplemented by the others, including the scream that leads into another great Harrison solo. John gets in a poignant ballad, ""If I Fell,"" as well as another terrific rocker, ""Any Time At All."" George also gets a turn at the mic on ""I'm Happy Just to Dance with You,"" a blissfully to-the-point ode to just wanting to dance with somebody. Only Ringo doesn't get a chance to shine, though his drumming is already significantly better than it was on the first two albums. This is a perfect pop record, matched in its simplicity and ceaseless energy only by the <a title=""[Artist43]"" href=""/artist/ramones"" class=""artist"">Ramones</a>' debut.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Well, not a great Beatles album, but anyway a very good one. Some real good tracks herein : the title track, ""Any time at all""...<br>Too short : 30 minutes.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I actually found this album in a phone booth... At the time a was not that big a Beatles fan but this album changed that big time. I used a lot of money on batteries to be able to hear this album over and over again... absolutely one og the best Beatles album...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's very tempting to call this their best album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">1986 saw the first official release of Beatles material in the Soviet Union.  Luckily, they went with the British versions.  Therefore, this is the full collection of Beatles songs rather than the George Martin soundtrack material.  This is one of the Beatles' best early albums no matter what country you get it from, so don't think you have to specifically check this out.  It is, however, a great addition to any collection, and is a piece of history.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">No covers on this one: should it be a good thing? Lennon wrote the most: should it be a good thing? Unfocused work, full of filler as all Beatles records are (especially in the first part of their career). ""You Can't Do That"" great bluesy track with nice riff, though.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Este es el primer gran disco de los Beatles, nacido como banda sonora de su mejor película, portadora de momentos que pasarán a la historia de imi imaginería individual, porque aquí realmente empezaron a hacer buenas sus propias canciones y es un punto de partida de lo que muchos consideran el mejor grupo de la historia del rock.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Just as I picked up Mark Lewisohn's excellent <em class=""rymfmt"">Complete Beatles recording sessions</em> book again, I am asked to review this album. So what does the book tell about this album? The sessions started on January 29 1964 in Boulogne sur Seine, France with ""Can't buy me love"". It ended with a 2 day session at Abbey Road (June 1 and June 2) where most of side 2 of the album was recorded. In between the album's recording sessions, the fab four also did their first US tour (remember the Ed Sullivan show?) and the film shooting for the movie of the same name. Mark Lewisohn also mentions this is the only Beatles album that features just Lennon/McCartney compositions (no covers, no Harrison or Starr compositions).<br><br>This album features some of the band's finest ballads. Lennon's in top form on ""If I fell"", ""And I love her"" and ""Things we said today"" remain highlights in McCartney's song catalogue and their harmonies on ""I'll be back"" still sound great 40 years later. But there's more: McCartney's ""Can't buy me love"" remains one of the best early Beatles singles, Lennon rocks as great as ever on <br>""Tell me why"", ""Any time at all"", ""I'll cry instead"" and ""You can't do that"", while his harmonica playing never sounded as good as on ""I should have known better"". ""I'm happy just to dance with you"" features a rare Harrison lead vocal on a Lennon/McCartney song. <br><br>This album and <em class=""rymfmt"">Help</em> remain the best of the Beatles' pre-<em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber soul</em> music. The movie hasn't aged very well, it looks ridiculous nowadays. But what hasn't dated is some of the most beautiful music by the best band of all time; that still sounds as wonderful as it did in 1964.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Come on!  555th of all time?  A great album with only one dog...When I Get Home.  Tell Me Why isn't my favourite, but the Beatles tribute band Rain has in the three times I've heard them made it number two on their play list.  I'll Be Back and Things We Said Today are magnificent.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">After With The Beatles' subpar showing for Lennon-McCartney originals, it was a risky venture indeed to follow up the album with a disc completely comprised of brand new said-Beatles-penned music. But the greatest rewards come from the greatest risks and A Hard Day's Night is undoubtedly the best all-around record from the Fab Four's early career. Although it still heavily clings onto upbeat, pop-rock songs of love and love lost -- a heavily-tred formula, without a doubt -- it is one masterfully written and recorded by the Beatles in 1964, at the height of their unfathomable popularity, and suits the popular demands of the time.<br><br>The album's A-Side (ie. the first 7-tracks) feature songs making up the soundtrack to the film of the same name, whereas the B-Side (the final six) are songs recorded in the same sessions, but were left out of the film. That's not to say one side is stronger than the other so much as to indicate the first side is comprised mainly of well-established, almost universally loved Beatles songs, and the flip side is generally lesser-known but equally worthwhile material.<br><br>One listen to A Hard Day's Night will make apparent what it was about the Beatles that was so special and inimitable. With hindsight, it may be looked upon as immature fluff pop, but it may also be recognized as being one of those records that come along few and far between: the ones that help shape and define an entire generation.<br><br>If I were stranded on a desert island and could only bring ten albums with me, you could bet your bottom dollar that A Hard Day's Night would be on that list.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first definitive Beatles album. There are no covers here, and the sound is less Chuck Berry or Buddy Holly-like ; the Beatles are now a band of their own. They gave up a part of their Hamburg-like sound to really invent pop music (although they weren't alone...)<br><br>There are lot of excellent tracks here. Even the weak ones sound kind, like ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" because they were used in the movie (a movie anyone wishing to understand beatlemania should watch).<br><br>Great songs, in order : ""A Hard Day's Night"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""I'll Cry Instead"", ""If I Fell""<br><br>OK songs : ""And I Love Her' (WAY too mellow), ""I'll Be Back"", ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"", ""Things We Said Today"", ""I Should Have Known Better"".<br><br>""Tell Me Why"" is the only mediocre song here.<br><br>Their best early album (with Help !, but this one is in the middle) and Lennon/Macca first masterstroke.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">If you wanna understand the early sixties:<br>check this album and get the movie!!<br>I love it!!</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles are continuing to grow with this record and start to move away from the gritty blues-tinged rock of their earlier albums.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">There's such a true and honest joy contained in this album, this was the peak of Beatlemania, before it became a burden on the young men who were the eye of pop cultures biggest hurricane. Something about being adored by every young girl on the planet, having your dreams reached and full of money and critical praise while in your early twenties that puts a group in a good mood. <br> The songwriting has taken full bloom on <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, every song being a Lennon/McCartney original. The songs are for the most part lively and up tempo including the two big singles, the title track and ""Can't Buy Me Love."" When The Beatles do slow things down the results are no less incredible, ""If I Fell"" and ""And I Love Her"" are John's and Paul's respectively and unlike most of The Beatles early works they stand up to the groups later more sophisticated songs.<br> These guys really were the right men at the right time, forget all the post J.F.K. America political timing of the group, but at a time when rock and pop music was still in its infancy, the genre could of folded and been remembered as a fad like the hula-hoop or pet rocks, but in 1964 Lennon and McCartney wanted nothing else but to write pop songs and by doing so kept the fires burning, that to this day show no sign of extinguishing. <br>""Let's write ourselves a swimming pool today John."" So they did.<br>""I'd like me a new motor car."" Poof! Another top 5 single and cash for several motor cars.<br>Awesome, incredible powers these two had at this time. An album that shows you what it's like to be young and on top of the whole bloody world.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Blazing hot out of the gates at a fleet sprint away from a hundred screaming teenagers, The Beatles had already been championing the hearts of the pop music scene, wetting millions of panties from Ed Sullivan's stage. Delicious, infectious pop tunes, an image of four young cute boys playing rock and roll, and the hair (<em class=""rymfmt"">swoon</em>). How could Beatlemania fist itself further into pop culture's gaping orifice? Oh, you know, maybe put out an album comprised exclusively of original material to be a companion to a full-length feature film starring the band being hilarious and playing over half the songs from the track list. I guess that might give rise to some whimpering moans from the bedrooms of the world's daughters. Sure.<br><br>Foremost, the title track is in my top twenty favorite songs from the Boys. It's energetic, catchy, it's got a bluesy and simple lyric, and people have written whole articles on <em class=""rymfmt"">the opening chord alone</em>. There have been lengthy arguments as to how it was composed and who played what; from what I recall I think it was still conjecture. I could be wrong. Anyway, though, how tantalizing. The first sound you hear on this album is so grand and mysterious that it sends a charge of fascination through people so deep that they have academic arguments over it. That should say something. <br><br>And as far as the other tracks go, at least the ones that show up in the film as well are some of the stronger Beatles tunes up until that point in their discography. 'I Should Have Known Better' is solid, 'If I Fell' is one of their better ballads of the early days with gorgeous harmonies and a brilliant structure, 'I'm Happy Just to Dance With You' is fairly poppy and safe but has a good energy about it, 'And I Love Her' is of moody mystique, 'Can't Buy Me Love' is an unstoppable machine of pop rock and roll and always has been. 'I'll Cry Instead' is also one of my favorites, a toe-tapping smilefest about wanting to break a bunch of hearts in light of a breakup but instead just crying. Happy, happy times.<br><br>The only weak points on this album are 'Any Time at All' and 'Things We Said Today.' Hearkening to thoughts I put down about some songs on <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em>, these two tunes feel very slapdash. The melody of 'Any Time at All' is a little cloying and carries a lyric that is one of the emptiest messages in the band's catalog, and 'Things We Said Today' has an interesting groove but hardly goes anywhere with it. But still, as with some of the songs on the prior album, they're good for what they are. Lennon and McCartney were excellent songwriters, so even if something droops below the <em class=""rymfmt"">awesome</em> mark, everything is still held together.<br><br><em class=""rymfmt"">Hard Day's Night</em> is the first wholly strong release from the Beatles based on the all-original factor alone, and since eleven out of those thirteen songs are certain ringers, that only makes it a stronger, more fantastic pop record.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Un des meilleurs albums du groupe - même si je les préfère sur la fin, dans leur période plus expérimetale. On peut quand même noter que cela vieillit pas mal (dans les deux sens d'ailleurs). Combien de groupes se sont-ils inspirés et s'inspirent-ils encore de ces 4 là? Quand je pense que c'est Michael Jackson qui touche maintenant les droits lorsque ces titres passent à la radio, ça me déprime...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">First album i ever received,and still as enjoyable today.From the opening <em class=""rymfmt"">Hard days night' </em>to the final <em class=""rymfmt"">'Ill be back'</em>,every one a pop classic.Buy it today,you wont be disappointed.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Highlights: <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">And I Love Her</em>, <em class=""rymfmt"">Can't Buy Me Love</em>, which are the universally-known songs from this album. But also the less-known songs show the incredible, timeless melodic talent of The Beatles, who always sport an otherworldly taste and overall quality, especially if compared with today's pop albums. After you listen to this record (to me, it happens about twice a year) these songs will stick in your brain for days. <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is the kind of album that raises rating problems: according to my standards, this is a 5 stars album (although maybe not even The Beatles' best) but if I rate this 5, I should lower most of my ratings by at least 2 stars...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">It's hard to review this album after hearing the Beatles later works. Unbiased, this album is pretty decent. Comparatively, it blows.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The peak of the early Beatles, but this would be a great album in any era. It's salutary to remind ourselves just what made the four so fab in the first place: their amazing gift for melody, their incredible harmonies, the deft way they mix raucous rockers with gentle balladry. ""If I Fell""! ""I'll Be Back""! ""Things We Said Today""! Really, they made greater albums, but they never made a better one.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is my favorite Beatles-LP. So - which one is yours?</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">Their first certified masterpiece. Certainly their purest release. Consisting solely of Lennon-McCartney compositions. Speak softly, child, you are in the presence of Greatness.</span>,<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">Turning Point in the XXth century Pop music!</em><br><br><strong class=""rymfmt"">Pure record!</strong></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Not much of a fan of The Beatles boy-band era. But, now that I'm older it probably deserves a more mature listen.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">I know. For some people, this is The Beatles as The Beatles can ever be. For some others, that is <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Pepper</em> or even the <em class=""rymfmt"">White Album.</em> There are lots of people, especially those belonging to the '60s generation, who think of The Beatles always as one – even if they <strong class=""rymfmt"">did</strong> change during their career, that was natural while the audience changed too. I was one of those who discovered, 'Hey, listen, the early Beatles and the cool hippie Beatles were two different bands.' In the late 1990s, I still had the impression I was one of that view's pioneers, while I had heard too much of that 'play Hey Jude then Twist and Shout' discourse. But now it seems, the two-different-bands discourse has become a paradigm itself. As a seeker and questioner, I begin to wonder if that is really the point. As a child I listened to The Beatles and that was enough! Be it <em class=""rymfmt"">Abbey Road,</em> be it ""A Hard Day's Night"" on the radio! Now some might think I am describing the process through which radicals become conservatives... while they forget to notice they are conservatively keeping up an old view themselves. Let the wheel, the page, the tide turn again!<br><br>By the way... Doesn't ""A Hard Day's Night"" (the song) sound a little like ""Back in the U.S.S.R.""? This is a musical notice, with nothing to do with the lyrics; but if you just don't think of the lyrics, aren't these two a bit like each other? A similar connection can be found between ""I Should Have Known Better"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing."" The equivalent of ""If I Fell"" is clearly ""Here, There and Everywhere"", while ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" comes close to ""Here Comes the Sun"" – with some extra energy, though. ""And I Love Her"" is ""Yesterday"" or even ""Because"" if you give it a try. ""Tell Me Why"" has an energy that is very similar to ""Magical Mystery Tour"", even though the songs may theoretically be far from each other. ""I'll Cry Instead"" is ""What Goes On"" without Ringo, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" can be ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" without the whimsical middle five (!). ""When I Get Home"" is a lot like ""Birthday"", ""I'll Be Back"" comes surprisingly close to ""The Fool on the Hill"", and the only thing that really separates ""You Can't Do That"" from ""Run for Your Life"" is that the latter has a worse lyric. More thinking was needed to find equivalents for ""Any Time at All"" and ""Things We Said Today"", but finally those were discovered: the former is ""Don't Let Me Down"" played extra fast, the latter is – surprisingly again, perhaps – ""Michelle."" And hocus pocus, abracadabra, there is a Beatle unity.<br><br>One of the main reasons that has made me think such things as above is the fact that in its own way <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is a great album. It can be compared to <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul</em> or <em class=""rymfmt"">Let It Be,</em> and it doesn't pale in comparison. First, <em class=""rymfmt"">Sgt. Pepper</em> may sound very different from <em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night,</em> but on the other hand, both aren't that far from <em class=""rymfmt"">Rubber Soul.</em> And so on. The question, remembering the 'two different bands' or not, remains 'is the music good or not?'. Well, ""Can't Buy Me Love"" has never been my true favourite, ""I'll Cry Instead"" is slightly lame, ""When I Get Home"" doesn't really have a character of its own and ""You Can't Do That"" contains lyrics I don't like. But most of the album tracks are brilliant pop songs. Especially ""Any Time at All"", ""And I Love Her"", ""If I Fell"", ""I'll Be Back"", ""I'm Happy Just to Dance With You"" and nowadays also ""Tell Me Why"" sound very fine to me. Yes, this is Beatle magic.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The Beatles are progressing in musical development in this album. The music sounds great, and there is not much else to say.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">With this album you can really see the Beatles becoming the group that would release rubber soul a year later. For me its still a little to bubble gum to be a truly great album but its great bubble gum.<br><br>Highlights<br>I'll Cry Instead<br>Can't Buy Me Love<br>You Can't Do That</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Like the title says, these are all the tracks that appear on the great Richard Lester film. What that means is that we receive some of the songs more than once, one with vocals and one just instrumental. The instrumentals being entirely different songs not just the vocals being removed, ""I Should Of Known Better"" for example has a little Mexican vibe to it with the harmonica from the original replaced with a little surf guitar riff. While ""And I Love Her"" dramatically overhauled with strings and a full orchestra sound. Given The Beatles insane popularity at the time, it's just natural that this was released even though it's only slightly different from the U.K. edition. This was an excuse for George Martin to show off some of his skills and give the more 'mature' re-workings of many of the songs, it was the first chance for adults to appreciate what the kids had known for a couple of years already.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Every song is a classic. Pop perfection.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description"">A Hard Days Night was released at a time where Beatlemania was hitting full swing.<br>The accompanying film was a sign of how huge they were becoming, so it seems appropriate that this coincided with their first full album of original songs, Lennon and McCartney looking to match the hype with a record of real substance.<br><br>From the moment you hear that first guitar chord ping, just before the title track explodes into life, you can feel a shiver down your spine at the anticipation of what is to follow. It is a song of course that the whole world knows well, full of punch and grit and featuring one of John’s most memorable vocals. Legend has it that the album title was conceived after a particularly grueling recording session, in which a dead tired Ringo meant to express what a hard days work it had been; and ended up tripping over his own words. This naturally appealed to John’s sense of humor and thus an album title was born.<br><br>There is a real energy and freshness here that lifts this record high above its predecessors. ‘Can’t Buy Me Love,’ ‘I should Have Known better’ and ‘Any Time At All’ are all rock tracks with remarkable melodies and stylized vocals from John and Paul, who compliment each other wonderfully. For the first time a Beatles record sounds like real fun as their enjoyment literally transcends to the listener.  <br><br>When the pace slows a little the results are just as effective. ‘If I fell’ is a beautiful poem-like track speaking of a naive love: “cause I've been in love before…and I found that love was more… than just holding hands” Lyrically basic yes but its magic is all in the delivery.<br>‘And I Love Her’ is another track sung beautifully by Paul, possessing an almost haunting quality. <br>On ‘You Can’t Do That’ John sounds positively venomous, his rasping vocals spitting out lines like: “Well, it's the second time I've caught you talking to him,” as Lennon plays the jealous guy long before said track was written. <br><br>Overall this was a landmark album not just for The Beatles, but also for popular music, one that sent four young boys on their way to global domination. This was a massive triumph for Lennon and McCartney who wrote the whole thing together, something they would never do so closely again as egos soon began to jostle for control.<br><br>Essential track: My personal favorite is: ‘You Can’t Do That’</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first album to feature only Beatle compositions, <em class=""rymfmt"">A hard days night</em> is a fantastic album, and a massive leap in quality from the first two albums. Lennon really comes into his own here, with some superb contributions including ""I should have known better"", ""You can't do that"", ""Tell my why"" and the fantastic ""If I fell"". Macca chips in with some gems too, ""And I love her"", ""Things we said today"" &amp; ""Can't buy me love"" all high quality. George's ""I'm happy just to dance with you"" is a bit flat but the album as a whole is quite brilliant.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Overall a good album, some great songs, some average.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Oh God this is sooooooo good.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is the only Beatle's album where John and Paul wrote all of the songs.  There are no covers and no songs by either George or Ringo.  This is one of my favorite ""early"" Beatle albums and I can never get tired of listening to it.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">A HARD DAYS NIGHT marks the first career highlight for The Beatles. All songs were written by Lennon/McCartney, and its obvious their own compositions easily top the cover recordings.<br>This record is a wild ride straight into Beatlemania, including rock`n`roll numbers as well as ballads. Milestones are McCartneys great and melancholic THINGS WE SAID TODAY (not AND I LOVE HER, i think its overrated and actually the only average song here), Lennons aggressive songs like YOU CANT DO THAT or ILL CRY INSTEAD or the incredible duets like ILL BE BACK or IF I FELL (not to speak of the famous singles). <br>You have to keep in mind that The Beatles had been touring the whole world at that time, were shooting movies, attended tv-shows etc.<br>It`s almost unbelievable that they still were able too write such amazing music within all the haze.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">My parents had this album, so I heard it enough.  Quite enjoy the title track, the rest does not thrill me.  That is perhaps because it is a little more rock and roll, and not the bland cheesy pop style of a lot of this sort of music that they did.  Anyway, the Beatles are really not my thing at all, in general.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Plenty of nice pop songs. Not that strong overall, but a pleasant experience nonetheless.</span>"
"<span itemprop=""description""><em class=""rymfmt"">A Hard Day's Night</em> is not the Beatles best album of course; However it has to be judged in its time context. Then we are in 1964 and their own compositions start to blossom so much that all the 14 songs are signed Lennon/McCartney. ""A Hard Day's Night"" has still got his magic first guitar chord, ""If I Fell"", ""Things we Said Today"" with ""And I Love Her"" are classics which still move me. This album is nearly a ""Best of"" of its time.<br>""I Should Have Known Better"" and ""Can't Buy Me Love"" are other timeless rock-pop classics.<br>Several songs here have been covered in French and that already proves the growing influence of Beatlemania in the music business.<br><br>No need to compare this album with the later ones. This one was perfect in its time and that's why I rate it 5*.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">With<em> A Hard Day's Night,</em> The Beatles did what they could never accomplish until they were all but broken up: produce an album without the glaring flaws that dragged everything down, usually courtesy of Paul trying to be fucking cutesy or some shit.<em> A Hard Day's Night </em>encompasses solid singles, upbeat feel-good songs, and more melancholy affairs like ""If I Fell,"" ""Things We Said Today,"" and ""I'll Be Back"" that showed a growing maturity that would blossom into arguably the finest career of all time. And anyway, it's just a fun album to listen to. People can't listen to The Beatles for fun anymore. They have to hear God in the mix somewhere, or else it's trash. Please note that God is not hiding in any Beatles' albums. No, not even<em> Revolver.</em></span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Another classic album by the Fab, <em class=""rymfmt"">A hard day's night</em> is a great improvement to <em class=""rymfmt"">With the Beatles</em> (which was also very good). Filled with instant classics, this album is the best example of what miracles Lennon and McCartney could achieve when they worked as a team. The entire album is filled with songs-results of their collaboration. For a third album in a row, the Beatles follow the same music formula to achieve success. Personally, I have no problem with that as the result is just fine and delivers pure entertainment. ""A hard day's night"", ""I should have known better"", ""And I love her"", ""Can't buy me love"" are all favourites, while songs like ""I'm happy just to dance with you"" and ""Any time at all"" are also highlights. Additionally, there are no cover songs on this album, which on previous works gave sceptics the opportunity to criticize the team badly.<br><br>19/20</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Very tight collection of their happy songs that most people love.  This is their third album, but really only their first outing featuring entirely self-penned songs.  At this point it's very pop, light and fluffy, and although they write excellent melodies there just isn't much depth or heart here.  Their musicianship is absolutely excellent, and they had huge hits with ""Can't Buy Me Love"" (which my sister thought was ""Camp Bobby Love"" when we were kids), ""And I Love Her"", ""Can't Buy Me Love"", ""A Hard Day's Night"", and ""Tell Me Why"".  I do like the material on here, I just don't love it.  <br><br>The album has been well put together, the production is great It's one heck of an album when you consider that it was 1964 and it's hard to deny their effect on popular music, but this album doesn't showcase the genius songwriters they were to become.  It's nice to have and fun to listen to, but the meaning is just not there.  Still a respectable album just so long as you are looking for some fun.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This is a Johnny Boy review<br><br>It is in on this album that the Beatles achieved pop perfection. This album is an exercise in how to write fantastic pop songs. There is not a bad track on here. The Beatles took what they had learned from 'Please Please Me' and 'With The Beatles' and turned it into something brilliant. It should also be noted that this record was the first to contain only original material - not a cover in sight and this album is all the better for it. The Beatles are on songwriting form and provide many memorable moments - the one chord intro to 'A Hard Days Night', the clever fade in intro to 'Eight Days a Week'. The Beatles had learnt how to begin their songs with style. Lennon is on great form again, providing the album's best tracks - the harmonica-driven brilliance of 'I Should Have Known Better', the emotional 'If I Fell' and the sneering anger and jealousy in 'You Can't Do That'. McCartney doesn't provide many tracks on this album but he does provide some great tunes - 'And I Love Her' and 'Things We Said Today' are equivalent to depressing love letters (except with better chord changes). It is obvious when listening to this album that the Beatles had taken pop music to a high level, a level impossible to pass without changing pop music itself (which the Beatles eventually did). Pop music may have its limitations but here you can enjoy in it in all its unashamed glory. It is also worth noting that at no point does it get overtly sentimental unlike their previous two albums. Excellent.<br><br>Check out my other reviews of Beatles albums. Johnny Boy</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">The first album where they begin to understand how best to embellish their songs. Also their first to showcase what would soon become their modus operandi: genre experimentation. You've got pure pop (""I Should Have Known Better""), Sun Records (""I'll Cry Instead""), early stabs at Dylan-esque songcraft (""I'll Be Back""), moody ballads (""And I Love Her""), and bluesy R&amp;B (""You Can't Do That"", ""Can't Buy Me Love""). They're getting there...</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">This was (in mono) the original North American release. I bought this (United Artists) album/soundtrack after getting my first record player in '65 and it has seen considerable playtime since. Many years later I bought the (Parlophone) UK release. While the Parlophone  issue contains more vocal tracks, six of them are not from the film. For this reason I find the original UA release with it's four instrumental cuts does a better job of recreating the smile that the film produced. I came to truly appreciate the instrumentals as the first overt appearance of George Martin. While hard to find today, I recommend this as the preferred release of this album.</span>,<span itemprop=""description"">Of course, music should always be judged on, well, the way it sounds and nothing else. But I think some reviewers are a little bit harsh on this little gem of a record when they view it as 'dated' or a bit 'simplistic'.<br><br>Firstly, it's impossible to underestimate what a parlous state rock n roll was in in the early 60s. Dirty rock n roll wasn't the sound of the day, it was ballads and twee pop <em>(Cliff Richard,</em><em> Helen Shapiro </em>et al). The Beatles' first two albums re-introduced that important x-factor back into music - SEX - by aping and shaping that rock 'n' roll they'd first heard coming off the ships from America in Liverpool.<br><br>But though the first two albums did all that, Lennon and McCartney were still finding their feet as songwriters - and half of the albums were decent covers but nothing new. For me, the real revolution starts with<em> A Hard Day's Night.</em> The first British album ever entirely written by its performers, it confirmed that Lennon and McCartney were already operating at the top of their game, and were not only coping with the pressure of having become incredibly famous, but were thriving on it. It was this album that led the astonishingly stuffy<em> Times </em>to compare them to Mozart, calling them the 'phenomenon of the year'.<em> That's </em>how revolutionary this record was.<br><br>Indeed, they'd moved ahead of the pack so quickly, that they struggled to repeat the feat later in the year with the slightly tired<em> Beatles for Sale.</em> And as for the so-called opposition around this time?<em> The Stones </em>were still yelping<em> Come On </em>and begging Lennon to write songs for them and<em> Brian Wilson </em>was only just waxing his non-existent surf board.<br><br>If you find the lyrical content a bit bland - boys in love, girls in love, innocent hand holding - listen to the delivery. Do you think George<em> really </em>just wants to just dance with you? You're having a laugh. How wonderfully mean does John sound on<em> You Can't Do That?</em> How much does he want a fuck on<em> Any Time At All?</em>! And how mature and heartfelt is Paul's<em> Things We Said Today?</em> The guy was 20 years old! This is the sound of four lads, barely out of their teens, having the time of their laugh and stretching their musical muscle with considerable flair. <br><br>If the<em> joie de vivre </em>and sheer musical class of this record aren't enough for you and you seek a more complex, darker, stoned Beatles, I understand, but give it its due,<em> A Hard Day's Night </em>lays down all the groundwork that, with a little more wacky backy and a few Dylan steals, eventually became the fully fledged chiming Rickenbacker sound of<em> Rubber Soul.</em><br><br>The final context for<em> A Hard Day's Night </em>is the 2nd World War. American RYMers should remember that you guys did rather well out of the war and stocked your freezers accordingly. We got shafted. Our crowded little island was bombed to shit and totally penniless for a generation. My mother grew up on rationing and saw her parents counting the pennies, never going out, not having any fun. She says that life seemed like it WAS actually in black and white. She also went to see<em> The Beatles </em>on this tour. She says you can't underestimate how quickly the world went technicolour in a few short years once the Brits learned to rock n roll. My Mum was no crazy rock n roller, she was just an ordinary girl from Essex, so I guess if it hit her, it hit everybody.<br><br>So ultimately for me, this is the sound of our tired little post-war island finally waking from rationing,  poverty - of ideas and ambitions as well as quotidian existence - and learning to sing, clap, twist and shout. Listen carefully and you'll hear those voices singing out of sheer relief of being alive. That's surely worth 5 stars in anyone's book.</span>"
